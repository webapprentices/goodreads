No one in a managerial role should be allowed to manage others without having read at least one book from Peter Drucker.  Drucker is widely acclaimed as The Father of Modern Management and published 39 books in a lifetime that spanned 95 years.  <strong>The Effective Executive</strong> was published in 1967 and this book is as good a starting point as any for the uninitiated.

Effectiveness is a habit and habits can be learned through practice, lots of it.  According to Drucker there are five habits that, once acquired, determine the effectiveness of an executive.  If you want to be effective in your work—and in your life—practice these five habits:

1. Know where your time goes.
2. Focus on outward contribution.
3. Build on strengths.
4. Concentrate on the few major areas where superior performance will produce outstanding results.
5. Make effective decisions.

The book provides detail and substance to these five habits of executive effectiveness.  The examples are a time capsule from the "Mad Men" era drawing on events from the Kennedy and Johnson administrations.  Don't let these dated examples lull you into thinking that "times have changed."  While they certainly have, the practices that lead to executive effectiveness have stood the test of time.
