This book offers insight into what it takes to grow a business.  It does not target start-ups, but rather companies of moderate size that wish to continue to grow.  Anyone in a leadership position in a moderate-size organization can benefit from the principles outlined in this book.

Based on meticulous research, the author compares nine companies that displayed long-term growth with industry competitors that stalled.  Similar in structure to Jim Collins' business classic Good to Great, eight principles of breakthrough are offered.

Three of my favorite quotes from the book help to frame these breakthrough principles:

"Progress always involves risk, you can't steal second base and keep your foot on first base."  Frederick Wilcox

"We cannot direct the wind, but we can adjust the sails." Bertha Calloway

"It is not the strongest of the species that survive, nor the most intelligent, but the ones most responsive to change." Charles Darwin

Read this book today and share it with other leaders in your organization.  Apply its principles and long-term growth is possible, both for you and your current organizationâ€”or the next one you join that aspires to build something great!
