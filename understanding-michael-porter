No business manager should be allowed to hold the title without having a working knowledge of the research and teachings of Harvard Business School Professor, <strong><a href="https://www.isc.hbs.edu/about-michael-porter/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank">Michael Porter</a>.</strong>  You can start with <strong><a href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/34857304">On Competition, Updated and Expanded Edition</a>,</strong> a dense masterwork.  Or you can capture the essence of three decades of research in this essential guide to competition and strategy.

Written by a long-time collaborator at the Harvard Business School, <strong>Understanding Michael Porter</strong> is divided into two parts: What is Competition? and What is Strategy?  After all, if there were no competition, there would be no need for strategy.

Understanding competition begins with understanding The Five Forces:

~ bargaining power of suppliers
~ bargaining power of buyers
~ threat of new entrants
~ threat of substitute products or services
~ rivalry among existing competitors

At its heart, business competition is about the struggle for profits.  Competitive advantage is not about trouncing rivals, it's about creating superior value.  It means that compared with rivals, you operate at a lower cost, command a premium price, or both.  These are the only ways one company can outperform another.  Competitive advantage is about superior performance.

Understanding strategy begins with successfully passing the five tests of good strategy:

~ a distinctive value proposition
~ a tailored value chain
~ trade-offs different from rivals
~ fit across value chain
~ continuity over time

The final chapter features an interview with Michael Porter.

Q. What are the most common strategy mistakes you see?
A. The granddaddy of all mistakes is competing to be the best, going down the same path as everybody else and thinking that somehow you can achieve better results.

Strategy means deliberately choosing a different set of activities to deliver a unique mix of value.
