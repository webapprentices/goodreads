A Sense of Urgency is my fourth and final recommendation for best business book of 2008. The other three were as follows:

What Got You Here Won't Get You There
Never Eat Alone
Launching a Leadership Revolution (Best Business Book of 2008)

One of the author's earlier efforts was the fable Our Iceberg is Melting. A Sense of Urgency provides substance to this fable.

Creating a sense of urgency is the first of eight steps that leaders in any organization need to master in order to improve business operations. John Kotter provides a masterful game plan.

True urgency focuses on critical issues and is driven by a deep determination to win. A false sense of urgency, prevalent in many workplaces, is characterized by people mistaking activity for productivity. This is a timely distinction given the current economic climate.

The author describes a strategy and four sets of tactics for increasing a true sense of urgency. The strategy can best be summarized as a "constant purging low value-added activities."

Kotter then proceeds to outline four tactics that business leaders can use to help ensure that urgency is routinely introduced and maintained in the workplace.

The natural order of the workplace is "urgency leads to success which leads to complacency which kills a sense of urgency." If your organization is not constantly purging low value-added activities during the current economic downturn, then perhaps A Sense of Urgency is in order.
