<blockquote>"The 1960s were just underway, the age of rebellion, and I was the only person in America who hadn't yet rebelled."</blockquote><p>Thus begins the education of Phil Knight. "The ultimate dream was to be a great athlete. Sadly, fate made me good, not great." So, at twenty-four he had a crazy idea. His favorite athletic activity was running and his crazy idea was to import high-quality, low-cost running shoes from Japan and sell them to his fellow running enthusiasts.</p><p>The concept for Nike was formulated in an MBA class on entrepreneurship at Stanford University in 1962. The idea was advanced when Knight shared it with his former track coach at the University of Oregon, Bill Bowerman. The business took shape when Knight began importing shoes from Japan. This retelling covers the early years of the company from 1962 to 1980.</p><p>After five years and a handful of employees, Knight still couldn't justify taking a salary. So, he grew the business of selling shoes while working accounting-related day jobs. It wasn't until after his 30th birthday that Knight felt comfortable drawing a full-time salary from his running shoe import company. The shoes were from a Japanese company called Tiger and Knight's import business was known as Blue Ribbon at the time.</p><p>Going into the 1968 Olympics the world's two biggest athletic shoe companies were Adidas and Puma. The Nike brand had still not yet been created. A contractual dispute between Knight and the Japanese company led to the birth of the Nike brand and the accompanying swoosh (It's the sound of something going past you) in 1971. The first athletes to wear Nike-branded shoes were members of the Portland Trailblazers. Then, the arrival of Steve Prefontaine and a running boom.Pre would die four years later at the age of 24 holding every American distance record from 2,00 meter to 10,000 meters.</p>
