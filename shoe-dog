<blockquote>The 1960s were just underway, the age of rebellion, and I was the only person in America who hadn't yet rebelled."</blockquote>

<p>Thus begins the education of Phil Knight. "The ultimate dream was to be a great athlete. Sadly, fate made me good, not great."</p> So, at twenty-four he had a crazy idea. His favorite thing was running and his crazy idea was to import high-quality, low-cost running shoe from Japan and sell them to his fellow running enthusiasts.

The concept for Nike was formulated in an MBA class on entrepreneurship at Stanford University. The idea was advanced when Knight shared it with his former track coach at the University of Oregon, Bill Bowerman.

After five years and a handful of employees, Knight still couldn't justify taking a salary. So, he grew the business of selling shoes while working accounting-related day jobs for others. This is how things were done in the era before venture capital. It wasn't until after his 30th birthday that Knight felt comfortable drawing a full-time salary from his running shoe import company which was known as Blue Ribbon at the time.
