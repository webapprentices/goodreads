This book is a gem -- small and valuable. It is the role of management to acquire these gem stones. Here are 10 stones worth polishing:

~ "We come in peace. We don't have imperial ambitions."

~ "The best companies aren't families. They're supporters of families."

~ "If you can't fit everything you want to do within 40 hours per week, you need to get better at picking what to do."

~ "Eliminate 7 of the 12 things, and you'll have time left for the 5. It's not time management, it's obligation management."

~ "It takes great restraint as the leader of an organization not to keep lobbing ideas at everyone. Every such idea is a pebble that's going to cause ripples when it hits the surface."

~ "Eight people in a room for an hour doesn't cost one hour, it costs eight hours."

~ "Following group chat at work is like being in an all-day meeting with random participants and no agenda."

~ "Modern-day offices have become interruption factories."

~ "People don't like to have their grievances downplayed or dismissed. When that happens, even the smallest irritation can turn into an obsessive crusade."

~ "Few things are as demoralizing as working on projects with no end in sight."

It Doesn't Have to Be Crazy at Work deserves its position on The Must-Read Shelf of the Best Business Books of 2018 .
