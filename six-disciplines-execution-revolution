Does your business seem to be in perpetual, reactive, fire-fighting mode?  If so, then, <strong>Six Disciplines Execution Revolution</strong> is for you.  Its focus is to help you and your organization plan and execute, while at the same time, manage the unknowns of the real world on a daily basis.

First, the author introduces the Business Excellence Model which graphically depicts the balance between an organization's strategy and its execution.  Fire-fighting is characterized by a combination of weak strategy and equally ineffective execution.  Strategy encompasses the choices of what to do versus what not to do to grow your business.  Execution evaluates how well those choices are carried out within your organization.  Business Excellence reflects the long-term journey to balance long-term strategic decisions with high-level daily execution against those strategies.

The following six disciplines provide a framework for achieving business excellence:

- strategizing
- planning
- organizing
- executing
- innovating
- learning

The process of excelling at each of these six disciplines involves four components that comprise the core of the book.

The only reason that this book did not rate five stars is that the four components involve proprietary technologies and outside consulting that leave the reader with a sense that the only way to achieve business excellence is to contact the author's organization and contract with their services.

The Six Disciplines Execution Revolution identifies the common barriers to business growth and long-term profitability.  Recognizing the obstacles is the necessary first step to helping you overcome them.
