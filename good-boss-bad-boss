<strong>How to Be the Best... and Learn from the Worst</strong>.  This subtitle captures the essence of <strong>Good Boss, Bad Boss</strong>.

There are more than 21 million bosses in the United States and more than 90 percent of employees have at least one.  Approximately 75 percent of the workforce reports that their immediate supervisor is the most stressful part of their jobs.  People do not quit organizations, they quit bad bosses!

The stakes are high.  Bad bosses destroy workplaces.

According to the author, a Stanford Management Professor, here are seven habits that the best bosses exhibit:

~ Take control.  "The first job of a leader is to define reality."
~ Strive to be wise by asking questions and listening well.
~ Recognize the team players and cut lose the rotten apples.
~ Link talk and action and get things done.
~ Serve as human shields and demonstrate that employees' backs are covered.
~ Don't delay or duck difficult deeds.
~ Squelch their inner jerk. (Bosses are often clueless about how followers interpret their actions.)

If you believe you are a good boss, ask your employees to "take the test" and quantify how good -- or how bad -- you really are.  Then, squelch your inner jerk and strive to be wise by asking questions and listening well.

Take control and "take the test."  Don't delay or duck difficult deeds.  "Take the test."

Remember to act as a human shield and let your employees know that you have their backs and they won't be punished for delivering less than rosy feedback.  "Take the test."
