I'm a fan of simple and this book is simple. The message is clear:

Being the Best in the World is Seriously Underrated

The Dip refers to "the long slog between starting and mastery." Extraordinary benefits accrue to the tiny minority who are able to get through The Dip by persisting longer than most.

To be the best at anything you have to quit. You have to quit the right stuff at the right time. Quit the Cul-de-Sacs of life -- those dead ends are aren't likely to take you anywhere. Once you quit Cul-de-Sacs (dead-end projects, hobbies, jobs, etc.) you can refocus your resources on getting through The Dip and mastering those few things in life that matter to you most.

How do you know which projects to quit? You should quit if the project (hobby, job, etc.) has a dip that isn't worth the reward at the end. Never quit anything with great long-term potential just because you can't deal with the stress of the moment.

Final thought: "A woodpecker can tap twenty times on a thousand trees and get nowhere, but stay busy. Or he can tap twenty-thousand times on one tree and get dinner."

I chose dinner over staying busy.
