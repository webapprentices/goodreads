Web 2.0 is about "joining the conversation" and <strong>Trust Agents</strong> provides a useful blueprint on the process.  "Trust agents" are business professionals who understand this blueprint and use the Web to build business.

Trust agents are power users of the new tools of the Web and have established themselves as being non-sales-oriented, non-high-pressure marketers.  One core concept to becoming a trust agent is to write everything online, where it is eternally visible to everyone.  If the content has value, you will build up your influence.  A blog, for example, becomes an archival resource.

Authors, Chris Brogan and Julian Smith, offer six behaviors that describe a trust agent.  While the categories are somewhat nebulous—One of Us, Agent Zero and Human Artist, for example—the recommendations are solid.  Brogan provides examples on how use the Web to stand out, how to develop access to key decision makers, and how to leverage your Web presence to enhance your influence.

The Web is one gigantic lever.  The broader your network, the greater your opportunities.  Reading <strong>Trust Agents</strong> (and taking small, consistent steps to implement the action items) will help you become a trust agent.  After all, if you have no Google results, you don't exist.
