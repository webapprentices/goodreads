<blockquote>Q: What is the difference between service and hospitality?</blockquote><blockquote>A: Service is black and white; service is color.</blockquote><strong>Black and white</strong> means you're doing your job with competence and efficiency. <strong>Color</strong> means you make people feel great about the job you're doing for them.

<strong>[book:Unreasonable Hospitality|60018618]</strong> is the story of an 11-year quest to transform a middling Manhattan restaurant into the top-ranked restaurant in the world.

Seven takeout side dishes to whet your appetite:

~ Run toward what you want, as opposed to away from what you don't want.

~ Receiving praise, especially in front of your peers, is addictive. You always want more.

~ If you can't find more compliments to deliver than criticism, that's a failure in leadership.

~ One of a manager's biggest responsibilities is to make sure people who are trying and working hard have what they need to succeed.

~ Practice <strong>The Rule of 95/5</strong>: Manage 95 percent of your business down to the penny; spend the last 5 percent "foolishly."
