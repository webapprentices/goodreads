This book can be read in one sitting -- and that would be a mistake. My first read through I rated the book three stars. I gave the book a second chance by rereading it in fifteen minute increments, first thing in the morning. Then, I upgraded my rating.

Sometimes simple is better. This book provides a simple approach to keeping your head on straight. Perhaps individual personality can't be changed, but outlook on life can be altered. The secret lies in learning to take advantage of bad times.

We all feel highs and lows -- Peaks and Valleys. Peaks and Valleys are a metaphor for Life. When we are in a Valley, sometimes all we need to is change what we are looking at.

This book explores strategies for the following:

~ how to get out of a Valley sooner
~ how to stay on a Peak longer
~ how to have more Peaks and fewer Valleys in the future

If you currently find yourself in a Valley, pick up this book and start reading in small chunks every day. How you experience your current Valley has a lot to do with how long you'll remain in it. Then, create a vision of a future Peak you want to be on and begin taking steps daily to walk out of that Valley and toward the next Peak.

Simple, yes. Daily, yes. Simple + daily works.
