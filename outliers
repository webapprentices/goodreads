In Outliers, Malcolm Gladwell wants to convince us that successful people are the beneficiaries of hidden advantages and extraordinary opportunities.

Two interesting examples include the following:

- why the most successful professional hockey players from Canada are born in the first three months of the year

- why some of the wealthiest technology entrepreneurs were born in 1955

Personally, I'm more likely to buy into his 10,000-hour rule to help level the playing field for most of the rest of us.  This rule states that achievement arrives when talent collides with preparation.  Ten thousand hours of practice is required to achieve the level of mastery associated with being a world-class expert.

The Beatles mastered their craft between 1960 and 1962 by performing eight hours a night for 270 nights in Hamburg (not quite 10,000 hours).  However, without talent, the opportunity to perform in Germany, and an extraordinary level of preparation, they might have never arrived in the United States in February, 1964 to alter the course of popular music.  

Additional research is also presented to demonstrate that the relationship between success and IQ works only up to a certain point.  IQ points beyond 120 don't appear to translate into a measurable real-world advantage.

According to Gladwell, the same appears to hold true for basketball where a player only has to be tall enough.  Michael Jordan was "only" 6'-6".  Other players have had successful NBA careers without such height, while still others have towered over their teammates, but perhaps lacked the "talent plus preparation" part of the equation.

Gladwell concludes that "no one -- not rock starts, not professional athletes, not software billionaires, and not even geniuses -- ever made it alone."

So, develop your social skills, and put in your 10,000 hours of practice, and you too can be a success!
