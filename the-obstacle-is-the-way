What is your biggest obstacle right now?  I know mine.  It can be overcome.  This book shines a light on The Way.

Turn it around.  Find some benefit.  Use it as fuel.

Overcoming obstacles is a discipline of three critical steps: Perception, Action and Will.

Perception—how we see and understand what occurs around us, and what we decide those events mean.

Action—the solution and the cure to our predicaments.  Action must be directed.  Step by step, action by action, we'll dismantle the obstacles in front of us.

Will—our internal power which can never be affected by the outside world.

Perception is the discipline of the mind.  Action is the discipline of the body.  Will is the discipline of the heart and soul.  Master these three disciplines and you can flip any obstacle upside down.

<strong>The Obstacle is the Way</strong> embodies the best practices of Stoicism, a philosophy that can become the operating system for the difficulties and hardships of life.

The following examples of individuals who have overcome significant obstacles are sprinkled throughout the book: John D. Rockefeller, Rubin "Hurricane" Carter, George Clooney, Tommy John, Amelia Earhart, Thomas Edison, Arthur Ashe, Abraham Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt and Thomas Jefferson.

However, Mike Tyson said it best ...<blockquote>"If you are not humble, life will visit humbleness upon you."</blockquote><strong>The Obstacle Is the Way: The Timeless Art of Turning Trials into Triumph</strong> is recommended reading that should NOT be placed on your bookshelf, but rather, on your nightstand to be referred to daily.
