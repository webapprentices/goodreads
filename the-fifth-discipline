<p>This is a book about "learning organizations" where people continually expand their capacity to create results and where people continually learn how to learn together. Why is this important? Because the ability to learn faster than your competitors "may be the only sustainable competitive advantage."</p>

<p>The first four disciplines of a learning organization are as follows:</p>

~ personal mastery — individuals committed to their own lifelong learning
~ mental models — deeply ingrained assumptions or generalizations that influence how we understand the world and how we take action
~ building shared vision — the capacity to hold a shared picture of the future we seek to create
~ team learning — teams are the fundamental learning unit in modern organziations

<p>The fifth discipline is "systems thinking." A discipline is a developmental path for acquring certain skills or competencies. "Systems thinking" is the discipline that integrates the other disciplines in a  way that the whole can exceed the sum of the parts. The potential of an organziation (or team) is realized when the first four disciplines are activated in a wholistic (disciplined) way.</p>

<p>I wanted to rate this book higher than a "three." I really did. However, "liked it" is a fair rating.</p>

<p>After all, <strong>[book:The Fifth Discipline: The Art & Practice of The Learning Organization|255127]</strong> is considered to be a business classic. And maybe that is the issue. More than 30 years after its initial publication, it doesn't appear as if the art and practice of learning organizations ever achieved escape velocity.</p>

<p>Many organziations have a "learning disability" that prevents them from achieving their potential. In many of these organizations, management tends to focus on the traditional metrics of management and is largely unaware of "the five disciplines" and how to activate them in indivdiuals and small groups. Individual potential is wasted as workers move on to join other teams. Not necessarily for better compensation, but rather, for better management.</p>
