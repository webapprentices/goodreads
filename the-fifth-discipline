I wanted to rate this book higher than a "three." I really did. However, "liked it" is a fair rating.

After all, <strong>[book:The Fifth Discipline: The Art & Practice of The Learning Organization|255127][book:The Fifth Discipline: The Art & Practice of The Learning Organization|255127]</strong> is considered to be a business classic. And maybe that is the issue. More than 30 years after its initial publication, it doesn't appear as if the art and practice of learning organizations ever achieved escape velocity.
