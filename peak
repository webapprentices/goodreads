Get your Mojo from Chip Conley and improve your business.  In [book:Peak: How Great Companies Get Their Mojo from Maslow|7251391] Conley presents a blueprint on how to construct a pyramid of happy employees, customers and investors.

Most employees in today's economy (those who are working) are working in "infectious fear factories" and it doesn't have to be that way.  Conley bases his Peak model on Abraham Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs which can be distilled into three essential levels: survival, success and transformation.  Employees, customers and investors each have their own pyramid consisting of these three levels.  Here is one example:

The Employee Pyramid

Transformation >> Meaning (top)
Success >> Recognition (middle)
Survival >> Money (bottom)

The author contents that most companies only pay attention to the bottom of the pyramid.  Employees receive only adequate compensation and employers believe this is enough to enable a highly motivated workforce.  Employees can't focus on higher needs on an empty stomach.  

By placing more emphasis on recognition and meaning, employers can tap into the need employees have for feeling successful and ultimately transformed -- once their basic survival needs are met.  

The three chapters on The Employee Pyramid offer any manager in any workplace enough value to benefit from implementing the ideas presented.  Because, after all, employees join companies, but they leave their managers.  Employee surveys reveal that nearly 70 percent of the variability in employee satisfaction is attributable to the quality of the employees' relationship with their manager.

Everyone can benefit from the three chapters on The Customer Pyramid.  The Investor Pyramid offers insights for those focused on obtaining outside funding for business growth.

If you work in an "infectious fear factory" consider reading [book:Peak: How Great Companies Get Their Mojo from Maslow|7251391].  Then, make a difference by adding some Mojo to your team.
