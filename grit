Our potential is one thing. What we do with it is quite another. So begins the quest to uncover why some people who fall down don't get back up.

One can define a "natural" as someone with early evidence of innate talent and a "striver" as someone with early evidence of high motivation and perseverance.

So, what is grit? Grit is more about stamina than intensity. Grit is about working on something you care about so much that you are willing to stay loyal to it. Grit is about holding the same top-level goal for a very long time. At the extreme one might call a person who exhibits grit to be obsessive.

The author defines grit as having a passion to accomplish a particular top-level goal and the persistence to follow through.

One formula for developing grit, especially early in life, is the following:

1. First comes interest.
2. Next comes the capacity to practice.
3. Third is purpose.
4. And, finally hope -- rising-to-the-occasion kind of perseverance.

At various points in our lives, in big ways and small, we get knocked down. If we stay knocked down, grit loses. If we get up, grit prevails.

Most people stink at the things they love. Most people stink even more at what they don't love. A life constructed around things you don't love stinks. Find something that interests you and then get to work practicing. With effort, talent becomes skill and, at the very same time, effort makes skill productive.

Olympic swimmer, Rowdy Gaines, summarized grit as follows: "I swam around the world for a race that lasted forty-nine seconds."

Grit deserved its ranking as one of the Best Business Books of 2016.
