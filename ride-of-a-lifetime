<blockquote>"I tend not to feel much anxiety when things go awry. And I tend to approach bad news as a problem that can be worked through and solved."</blockquote>Thus begins the journey of Robert Iger, long-time CEO of the Walt Disney Company. He worked for different incarnations of that company for forty-five years, rising to the top for the final decade and half.

The chronological retelling is pretty standard fare for autobiographies. However, this story is different, because the events described were a highly visual sports and entertainment greatest hits reel for a generation of baby boomers, even if the Robert Iger name behind the story board was not.

His career began at ABC Television where had 20 jobs and 14 bosses. He would "show up wherever they needed me, for whatever task." Mostly he developed the work ethic to tolerate the demanding hours and the extreme workload of television production. "It was important to me to know that when it came down to it, I could outwork anyone else."

Then, Disney acquired ABC. For the next decade Iger would lead various divisions of the company. Eventually, after 15 interviews, including one-on-one interviews with every member of the board of directors, he was named Disney's CEO.

In this role he would oversee the successful acquisitions of Pixar, Marvel Entertainment and Lucasfilm. The addition of 21st Century Fox would create a corporate behemoth. With a universe of quality content at his disposal the final peace of the puzzle would be to distribute that content directly to consumers via Disney+.

In summing up his corporate journey Iger describes 10 principles "that strike me as necessary to true leadership."
