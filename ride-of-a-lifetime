<blockquote>"I tend not to feel much anxiety when things go awry. And I tend to approach bad news as a problem that can be worked through and solved."</blockquote>

Thus begins the journey of Robert Iger, long-time CEO of the Walt Disney Company. He worked for different incarnations of that company for forty-five years, rising to the top for the final decade and half. The chronological retelling is pretty standard fare for autobiographies. This story is different, however, because the events described were highly visible, even if the Robert Iger name behind them was not.
