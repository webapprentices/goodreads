"What I was doing at work wasn't working." If you have ever felt like that, then this book is worth a look.

Sprints offer a path to solve big problems, test new ideas, get more done, and do it faster. A sprint in this case refers to Google Venture's unique five-day process for answering critical questions through prototyping and testing ideas with customers. This book is a DYI guide for conducting a sprint to help you answer pressing business questions about which products and services your organization should produce.

Failure is common when launching a new product or service. When our new ideas fail, it's usually because we were overconfident about how well customers would understand our solution and how much they would care about a solution to problem they may not have.

Think of a sprint as a five-day offsite meeting for planning, prototyping and interacting with customers. You and your team will need to clear the deck of daily work responsibilities.

Here is what five days of a design sprint looks like:

Monday > Map
Tuesday > Sketch
Wednesday > Decide
Thursday > Prototype
Friday > Test
