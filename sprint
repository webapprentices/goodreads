<b>"What I was doing at work wasn't working."</b> If you have ever felt like that, then this book is worth a look.

A Sprint offers a path to solve a big problem, test a new idea, and get closer to the end-user. A Sprint, in this case, refers to Google Venture's unique five-day process for answering critical questions through prototyping and testing ideas with customers. This book is a DIY guide for conducting a Sprint to help you answer pressing business questions about which products and services your organization should produce.

Failure is common when launching a new product or service. When our new ideas fail, it's usually because we were overconfident about how well customers would understand our solution and how much they would care about a solution to problem they may not have.

Think of a Sprint as a five-day offsite meeting for planning, prototyping and interacting with customers. You and your team will need to clear the deck of daily work responsibilities.

Here is the basic structure for a five-day design Sprint:

Monday > Map
Tuesday > Sketch
Wednesday > Decide
Thursday > Prototype
Friday > Test

The authors provide ample detail for what happens on each day along with examples of actual Sprints conducted with companies in the Google Ventures portfolio. With the techniques in this book, you can bring focus to work that matters. Now, all I need is an idea, a team to work with and some customers.
