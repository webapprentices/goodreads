This book is designed to set you up for success by helping you answer one question:
<strong><blockquote>What is the ONE Thing you can do today such that by doing it everything else will be easier or unnecessary?</blockquote></strong>To stay on track for the best possible day, month, year or career, you must keep asking this question, again and again, until it forces you to line up tasks in their leveraged order of importance.

First, a few troublesome research factoids:

~ Workers are interrupted every 11 minutes and then spend almost a third of their day recovering from these distractions.
~ Workers lose 28 percent of an average workday to multitasking ineffectiveness.
~ Workers who use computers during the day change windows or check e-mail or other programs nearly 37 times an hour.

Big success comes when we do a few things well.

Here are two strategies you should employ to help you do a few things well:

~ Find the lead domino and whack away at it until it falls.
~ Say "not now" to anything else you could do until your most important work is done.

Here is the ONE Habit you should develop to help you do a few things well:
<strong><blockquote>Create a four-hour time block of uninterrupted time (typically in the morning) so that you can focus on your ONE Thing.</blockquote></strong>On average it will take you 66 days to acquire this new habit.

Protect your time block at all costs.  Reschedule your time block in the event that an unscheduled priority disrupts your regular time block.

Work your time block, DAILY.  Then, check your e-mail or other programs 37 times an hour for each of the remaining hours and watch your productivity soar!
