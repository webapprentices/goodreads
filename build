<blockquote>So when you're looking at the array of potential careers before you, the correct place to start is this: "What do I want to learn?"</blockquote>Thus began the career journey of Tony Fadell who moved from Michigan to Silicon Valley at age 21 to become employee #29 at General Magic.

At General Magic, Tony learned the value of creating products that solve pain points, frustrations that a lot of customers experience daily.

From venture capitalist Bill Gurley, Tony learned, "I can't make you the smartest or the brightest, but it's doable to be the most knowledgeable. It's possible to gather more information than somebody else."

Tony moved on to Apple where he was involved in the design and launch of the iPod and the iPhone.

At Apple, he learned the value of prototyping as much of the full customer experience as possible, making the intangible tangible. He also learned the value of storytelling. He learned from Steve Jobs.

Tony moved on to Nest where he learned to build a business.

Along the way, Tony learned a few things about management:

~ Remember that once you become a manager, you'll stop doing the thing that made you successful in the first place.
~ Becoming a manager is a discipline.
~ Being exacting and expecting great work is not micromanagement.
