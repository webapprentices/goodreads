Zappos.com delivered results—$0 revenue to $1B revenue in under 10 years.  <strong>Delivering Happiness</strong> is the self-penned story of the journey of Tony Hsieh (pronounced "Shay"), CEO of Zappos.com.

Happiness isn't delivered until the second half of this book, starting with a chapter called "Platform for Growth: Brand, Culture, Pipeline."  The first half of the book merely sets the stage, chronicling Tony's journey growing up in Marin County, California, the son of Taiwanese immigrants.  Off to college at Harvard.  First job at Oracle.  First start-up: LinkExchange, sold to Microsoft for $265 million.

Hsieh took the proceeds from LinkExchange and invested in a company that became Zappos.com.  He became CEO.  The "Platform for Growth" chapter focuses on the company's decision to invest time, money and resources into three key areas:

~ customer service (Brand)
~ culture (Culture)
~ employee training and development (Pipeline)

Brand, Culture, Pipeline (BCP) became the competitive advantage that facilitated company growth.  Along the way Zappos was honored as one of Fortune magazine's Best Companies to Work For.

Hsieh's insights into customer service and the delivery of WOW experiences provide lessons for all business managers.  His focus on core values is refreshing in that the company appears to live by these values and not merely post them on a wall.

The book concludes with a discussion of happiness.  This final chapter was potentially the most beneficial and perhaps the most disappointing because of its brevity.  Maybe there is a sequel in the works.  Until then, we'll have to settle for the Delivering Happiness Bus Tour traveling through a city near you in late 2010.
