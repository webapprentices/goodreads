Hard work and perseverance don't lead to success.  Smart work does.  This is a book about working smart.

It is also a book that every business manager should read regardless of work setting.  You do not have to be a "risk-taking" entrepreneur to benefit from Lean Startup concepts.  Even established companies struggle to uncover new sources of growth.  <strong>The Lean Startup</strong> presents a system to identify and unleash these opportunities.  This book attempts to put entrepreneurship and innovation on a rigorous footing.

The goal of a startup is to figure out the right thing to build—the thing customers want and will pay for—as quickly as possible.  <strong>The Lean Startup</strong> presents a framework for accomplishing this goal.

At the core of a Lean Startup operation is the <strong>Build-Measure-Learn</strong> feedback loop.

~  <strong>Build</strong> a (minimum viable) product.
~ <strong>Measure</strong> results by engaging customers for the product.
~  <strong>Learn</strong> what features customers will pay for and which they do not value.

Success is a function of how quickly you navigate the loop, and therefore, how quickly you improve.

The most difficult part of this equation is building the minimum viable product (MVP).  Most entrepreneurs and business managers want to build the "best" product before putting it in front of customers.  Ries recommends building a good-enough product and getting it in front of customers early to get honest feedback.  This avoids the wasted energy of building stuff that no one wants or is willing to pay for.

Pitfalls along the way to guard against include "vanity metrics" (number of Facebook fans) and "success theater" (the work we do to make ourselves look successful).  Key decision points include "the pivot" (knowing when to make a structured course direction).  Pivot decisions are made to avoid getting stuck in the land of the living dead (achieving a modicum of success, just enough to stay alive, without living up to full potential).

The only way to win in the innovation economy is to learn faster than anyone else.  <strong>The Lean Startup</strong> offers hope to the innovator in all of us.
