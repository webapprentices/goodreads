This is a quirky little bookâ€”a book about productivity.  If you can't find stuff because you live (or work) in a cluttered environment, this hampers your productivity.  If you look around and you feel uninspired it could be that you find your environment uninspiring and it is time for "tidying up."

The work of tidying up is simple and consists of two parts:

~ deciding whether or not to dispose of something
~ deciding where to put it

The process is even simpler:

~ Start by discarding.  Then, organize your space, thoroughly, completely, in one go.

Most people who attempt tidying up have the process backwards: put stuff away first, then discard.  The challenge with this approach, however, is that once we put stuff away (i.e. hide it) we never get to the discard process, leaving stuff buried, in closets, in drawers, in garages, in basements.<blockquote>"Putting things away creates the illusion that the clutter problem has been solved."</blockquote>Tidying must start with discarding!

In an odd way this book is a companion to <strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/83990739">Getting Things Done</a>.</strong>  While David Allen's mantra is "mind like water," Marie Kondo's is "Does this spark joy?"  If it does, keep it.  If not, discard it.

Surround yourself only with those items that spark joy.  Free those other items from the prison to which you have relegated them.  When you discard something you should say, "Thank you for giving me joy when I bought you," and, then, let it go with gratitude.  Make your parting a ceremony to launch them on a new journey.
