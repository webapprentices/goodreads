Over the past decade the Subscription Economy has taken hold.

One of the landmark companies that led the charge was Salesforce.com. Instead of buying and installing software, rent it. The author had a bird's-eye view of the evolution from product to service as employee #11. His current company provides support services to companies wishing to make the transition from buying to renting.

The author makes a compelling case for the current transition away from products and toward services. Now that we live in a digital world we prefer outcomes over ownership. We want constant improvement, not planned obsolescence.

Just a few of the Big Box stores that have disappeared in the past decade include the following: Circuit City, Tower Records, Bockbuster, Borders, Virgin Megastore.

Ten years ago there was no Spotify and Netflix was a DVD company.

The emerging business model revolves around services, not products. "It isn't that retail is dead. But bad brick-and-mortar is." The Service Economy business model starts with the customer instead of the product. It's about establishing ongoing relationships. The new business model imperative is to grow and develop a dedicated subscriber base. Treat your customers like subscribers -- partners in an ongoing, mutually beneficial relationship.

The case studies about Adobe's and PTC's transitions to subscription services are informative. The author contends that "every company has the potential to reinvent and thrive in the Subscription Economy."
