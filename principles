<blockquote>Principles are fundamental truths that serve as the foundation for behavior that gets you what you want out of life.</blockquote>  This is a book of principles.  Lots of them.  "Having a good set of principles is like having a good collection of recipes for success."  Therein lies the one drawback about this compendium: it reads like a cookbook.

This three-part volume consists of Dalio's biography, life principles and work principles. 

In Part 1 the authors explains how he developed an investment company around the concept of a meritocracy that encourages thoughtful disagreement.

In Part 2 he presents life principles that he learned though a lifetime of trial and error.  One principle is to fail, learn and improve quickly.

In Part 3 he presents work principles based around the concept that an organization is a machine consisting of two parts: culture and people.

Ray Dalio's Principles are useful and practical, if somewhat rigid and strident, at times.  Nonetheless, this 500+page volume should be on a short list of books that business leaders read and practice.  <strong>[book:Principles: Life and Work|34536488]</strong>has earned its stop among <strong><a href="http://beantownweb.blogspot.com/2018/01/best-business-books-2017.html" target="_blank">The Best Business Books of 2017</a></strong>.
