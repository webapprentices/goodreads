If you are looking for a blueprint on how to develop a workplace culture, then this book offers a solid starting point. After all, Google (Alphabet) is one of the most valuable companies on the planet (by market capitalization). This level of performance does not happen by accident.

"You can't understand Google ... unless you know that both Larry (Page) and Sergey (Brin) were Montessori kids." In this educational format, children are encouraged to question everything, act of their own volition, and create. The two co-founders wanted to build a company that each would enjoy working in. To embrace the Google culture you must first choose whether you want to be a founder or an employee. It's a question of attitude.

Useful information can be found in every chapter. I'll focus on just one actionable finding—the <b>Project Oxygen</b> study which set out to prove that managers don't matter and ended up demonstrating that good managers were crucial. The research revealed eight common attributes shared by high-scoring managers and not exhibited by low-scoring managers:

~ Be a good coach.
~ Empower the team and do not micromanage.
~ Express interest in and concern for team members’ success and personal well-being.
~ Be productive and results-oriented.
~ Be a good communicator—listen and share information.
~ Help the team with career development.
~ Have a clear vision and strategy for the team.
~ Have important technical skills that help advise the team.

If all managers in your organization follow these <b>Work Rules</b>, then your organization has the potential  to be rated one of the best places to work. What's not to like about that?
