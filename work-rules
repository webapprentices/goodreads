~ Be a good coach.
~ Empower the team and do not micromanage.
~ Express interest in and concern for team members’ success and personal well-being.
~ Be productive and results-oriented.

~ Help the team with career development.
~ Have a clear vision and strategy for the team.
~ Have important technical skills that help advise the team.
