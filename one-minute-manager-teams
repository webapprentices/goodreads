Another entry in the <a href="https://www.kenblanchardbooks.com/books/" target="_blank"></b>The One Minute Manager</b></a> library series by Ken Blanchard. Another valuable contribution to the body of knowledge of those aspiring to become effective managers, and therefore, team leaders.

Today's leader must be an enabler of people and a facilitator of teams. "We need managers who can focus the group's attention and enthusiasm on continuous improvement."

What is most often overlooked is the teams stage of development. The process of devloping a high performing team involves three skills: 

~ Diagnosis
~ Adaptablility
~ Empowerment

Teams progress through four stages:

1. Orientation
2. Dissatisfction
3. Integration
4. Production

As a leader, you must change your leadership style depending on the current stage of group development. Changing your leadership style requires becoming a Situational Leader. Most leaders have one style: delegator or micromanager, for example. These styles serve a particular need, depending on the situation. Effective managers implement one of four styles to meet the needs of individuals and teams.

What drags this book down, compared to other books in the series, is the lack of simplicity. The situations can be difficut to diagnose, and even more challenging to shift leadership stye without practice.
