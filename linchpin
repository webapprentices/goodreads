<blockquote>"The best future available to us is a future where you contribute your true self and your best work."</blockquote>  Seth Godin shows us how to become a <strong>Linchpin</strong> and create that best future.

Becoming a Linchpin is a process that can be learned like all other skills.  Every organization needs a Linchpin, the one person who can bring projects and people together and make a difference.  Indispensable workers help make organizations indispensable and the race to becoming a high-value organization begins.

Part of the formula to becoming a Linchpin is to do hard emotional work because organizations won't pay extra for someone who merely does the easy stuff.  Godin refers to this work as "art"â€”anything that is creative, passionate and personal.  "Art" is a personal gift that changes the recipient.  When we create art and connect emotionally with recipients of that art we begin the process of becoming a Linchpin.

Over time gifts accrue and you have created a reputation.  When organizations begin to downsize the safest job belongs to the artist -- the linchpin -- the one who can't be easily outsourced or replaced.

Another part of the Linchpin formula is "real artists ship."  The discipline of shipping -- getting your art out the door on schedule -- is essential in the long-term path to becoming indispensable.  Shipping is the collision between your work and the outside world.  Many people have ideas.  Linchpins bring their ideas to market, on time.

Seth Godin writes a lot of books.  Some I've liked a lot -- [book:Permission Marketing|685401], [book:Purple Cow|641604], [book:The Dip|13079].  Others, not so much -- [book:Tribes|6289283].  But Seth will always challenge you and make you think.  Seth ships.  Seth is a Linchpin.

[book:Linchpin|7155145] becomes my third candidate for Best Business Book of 2010.  The other contenders are [book:Getting Things Done|1633] and [book:How Did That Happen|2519058].
