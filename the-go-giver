The greatest leader is the servant leader.  This is a story of the transformation of a go-getter into a go-giverâ€”a servant leader.

In this story, Joe is an ambitious young man aiming for the stars; and desperately trying to land a large account.  Joe is seeking leverage to land this account and decides he needs some "big guns" to help him.  His network introduces him to Pindar (a.k.a. The Old Man, a.k.a. The Chairman).

Joe learns from Pindar that the majority of people operate with a mindset that approaches a fireplace as follows: <blockquote><strong>First give me some heat, <em>then</em> I'll throw on some logs.</strong></blockquote> Joe recognizes some truth in Pindar's words and agrees to Pindar's proposal: Pindar will teach Joe the Five Laws of Stratospheric Success over the next five days, if Joe agrees to test each law by actually trying it out each day before receiving the next law.  Not by thinking about it.  Not by talking about it.  But by applying it to his life.

Pindar arranges meetings with other "big guns" so that Joe can learn each of the Five Laws.  As Joe practices each Law he begins to understand.  Learn ... apply ... change behavior.

<strong>The Go-Giver</strong> is valuable for anyone who struggles to learn why things aren't working and wants to internalize the value of "throwing on some logs" in order to receive heat.  Bedside material to read and reflect on nightly, and practice daily, until the heat appears in abundance.
