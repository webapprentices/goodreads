If you work for a living, read this book.  If you manage other people, read this book; place it on your desk and refer to it daily!

<strong>The Oz Principle</strong> is the book of accountability.  Accountability produces results.  Results are what every business needs.  Results are what every individual needs if s/he wants a better life.

The core premise revolves around staying "above the line."  Below the line lives victimization and the blame game.  We all fall below the line, feeling like we are victims, blaming others at work, at home, in society for our misfortunes.  Many of us fall below the line daily, even hourly.  We interact with others who feel like victims and join the conversation.

While it might be "OK" to have an occasional "pity party," it is not productive.  And, the longer we remain in victimization mode the less productive we become.

Staying "above the line" means following the four steps to accountability: See it, Own it, Solve it, Do it.

<strong>See it</strong>: Accountability begins with clearly defining the results you want and need to achieve.

<strong>Own it</strong>: Owning our circumstances allows us to move forward and achieve more satisfying results.

<strong>Solve it</strong>: An attitude and behavior initiated by continuously asking "What else can I do?"

<strong>Do it</strong>: Follow the Sundown Rule—get things done today, before the sun goes down.

The book is filled with handy checklists and self-assessments.  A skilled manager can use these tools to initiate a dialogue with team members.  However, communication skills will be required to avoid an all-out revolt if your workplace borders on dysfunctional.  For a systemic approach to applying these principles, check out a companion book by the same authors entitled <strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/75262802">How Did That Happen?</a>.</strong>

In the meantime read this book and start getting results for yourself.  Then, and only then, can you begin applying the accountability model to influence others in your life, including coworkers, subordinates, friends and family members.

Remember, you can either be a victim or you can hold yourself accountable—you can either get stuck, or get results.  Period.  Case closed.
