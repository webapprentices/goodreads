<blockquote>"Leadership is communicating others' worth and potential so clearly that they are inspired to see it in themselves."</blockquote><blockquote>~ Stephen R. Covey</blockquote>

<p>Great leadership begins first with character. The seven habits framework is both practical and profound.</p>

<blockquote>"To learn and not to do is reallly not to learn."</blockquote><blockquote> ~ Stephen R. Covey</blockquote>

<p>The one habit I've incorporated into my daily routine the most consistently is <strong>Habit 2: Begin with the End in Mind</strong>. My productivity toolset includes <strong>The 7 Habits</strong>, <strong>Getting Things Done</strong> and <strong>Agile Project Management</strong>. These tools are contained in a Trello toolbox. One of my 10 Trello boards is labeled <strong>Product Portfolio</strong>. I begin each day wtih a review of the list of "products" I will deliver by the end of the month. This habit helps keep me focused and motivated. Returning to <strong>Habit 2</strong> helps me the most when I find myself in the "thick of thin things."</p>
