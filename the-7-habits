<blockquote>"Leadership is communicating others' worth and potential so clearly that they are inspired to see it in themselves."</blockquote><blockquote>~ Stephen R. Covey</blockquote>

<p>Great leadership begins first with character. <i>The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</i> is a principle-centered, character-based, inside-out approach to personal and interpersonal effectiveness. The 7 Habits framework is both practical and profound.</p>

<p>There is simply too much quality content here to summarize effectively, so I'll just mention two of the seven habits. First, the world would be a much better place if we all stopped, took a few breaths and practiced <strong>Habit 5: Seek First to Understand, Then to Be Understood</strong>. Most people don't listen with the intent to understand; they listen with the intent to reply. They're constantly projecting their own home movies onto other people's behavior.</p>

<p>On a personal note, the one habit I've incorporated into my daily routine most consistently is <strong>Habit 2: Begin with the End in Mind</strong>. My productivity toolset includes <strong>The 7 Habits</strong>, <strong>Getting Things Done</strong> and <strong>Agile Project Management</strong>. These tools are contained in a Trello toolbox. One of my 10 Trello boards is labeled <strong>Product Portfolio</strong>. I begin each day wtih a review of the list of "products" I will deliver by the end of the month. This habit helps keep me focused and motivated. Returning to <strong>Habit 2</strong> helps me the most when I find myself in the "thick of thin things."</p>
