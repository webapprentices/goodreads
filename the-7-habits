<blockquote>"Leadership is communicating others' worth and potential so clearly that they are inspired to see it in themselves."</blockquote><blockquote>~ Stephen R. Covey</blockquote>

<p>Great leadership begins first with character. <i>The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</i> is a principle-centered, character-based, inside-out approach to personal and interpersonal effectiveness. The 7 Habits framework is both practical and profound.</p>

<p>There is simply too much quality content here to summarize effectively, so I'll just mention two of the seven habits.</p>

<p>First, the world would be a much better place if we all stopped, took a few deep breaths and practiced <strong>Habit 5: Seek First to Understand, Then to Be Understood</strong>. Most people don't listen with the intent to understand; they listen with the intent to reply. They're constantly projecting their own home movies onto other people's behavior. If each one of us employed more empathic listening, we would begin to heal the great divisions that exist in our society today.</p>

<p>On a personal note, the one habit I've incorporated into my daily routine most consistently is <strong>Habit 2: Begin with the End in Mind</strong>. In addition to <i>The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People</i>, my productivity toolset includes <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1434404368" target="_blank"><strong>Getting Things Done</strong></a> and <a href="https://webapprentices.org/prepare-for-the-pmi-acp-certification/" target-"_blank"><strong>Agile Project Management</strong></a>. These tools are contained in a <a href="https://webapprentices.org/trello-for-agile-teams/" target="_blank"><strong>Trello</strong></a> toolbox. One of my 10 Trello boards is labeled <strong>Product Portfolio</strong>. I begin each day with a review of the list of "products" I will deliver by the end of the month. This habit helps keep me focused and motivated. Returning to <strong>Habit 2</strong> helps me the most when I find myself in the "thick of thin things."</p>
