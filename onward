<strong>Onward</strong> is not a how-to book.  It is a first-person narrative of the two-year journey of Howard Schultz and lessons learned upon his return as CEO of the company he purchased in 1987.

During this journey Starbucks survived the Great Recession by closing 600 underpeforming stores, launched a failed product called Sorbetto, introduced a mild coffee called Pike Place Roast, established a loyalty program, provided a value-added Wi-Fi service, and introduced VIA Ready Brew, Starbucks coffee in an instant.

Here are the key leadership lessons Schultz learned during his two-year journey:

~ Grow with discipline.
~ Balance intuition with rigor.
~ Innovate around the core.
~ Don't embrace the status quo.
~ Find new ways to see.
~ Never expect a silver bullet.
~ Get your hands dirty.
~ Listen with empathy and overcommunicate with transparency.
~ Tell your story refusing to let others define you.
~ Use authentic experiences to inspire.
~ Stick to your values, they are your foundation.
~ Hold people accountable but give them the tools to succeed.
~ Make the tough choices; it's how you execute that counts.
~ Be decisive in times of crisis.
~ Be nimble.
~ Find truth in trials and lessons in mistakes.
~ Be responsible for what you see, hear, and do.
~ Believe.

To be honest I was never a Starbucks zealot.  I was one of those cynics who referred to Starbucks coffee as "burnt."  The introduction of Pike helped turn me around.  I have become a frequent visitor to "laptopistan" since the introduction of free Wi-Fi.  For a 12-bit cup of Pike I can be productive for an entire afternoon.  Starbucks has become my "third place."  I have witnessed Starbucks turnaround and count myself as one of its valued customers.

At its core, leadership is about instilling confidence in others.  If you are looking for a solid book on leadership <strong>[book:Onward: How Starbucks Fought for Its Life without Losing Its Soul|9151181]</strong> should be added to your short list.
