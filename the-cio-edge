"Soft skills yield hard results."

This is the simple take-home message from <strong>[book:The CIO Edge|8784637].</strong>

"No amount of technology can replace the power of motivated and energized people."

Three authors offer a well-documented approach to managing the people side of technology. Research is provided by Korn/Ferry International (KFI), a provider of executive talent management solutions and Gartner, Inc. a global leader in information technology research and advice.

High performing CIOs (and other business leaders) distinguish themselves by mastering seven skills:

~ Committing to being a leader first.
~ Leading differently than they think.
~ Embracing their softer side.
~ Forging the right relationships to drive the right results.
~ Practicing communication mastery.
~ Inspiring others.
~ Building people, not systems.

Among the subtitles discussed are distinctions between the following:

~ providing influence and persuasion vs. giving orders.
~ receiving commitment vs. getting compliance.
~ guiding people's passions vs. doing things my way.
