"Soft skills yield hard results."

This is the simple take-home message from The CIO Edge.

"No amount of technology can replace the power of motivated and energized people."

Three authors offer a well-documented approach to managing the people side of technology. Research is provided by Korn/Ferry International (KFI), a provider of executive talent management solutions and Gartner, Inc. a global leader in information technology research and advice.

High performing CIOs (and other business leaders) distinguish themselves by mastering seven skills:

~ Committing to being a leader first.
~ Leading differently than they think.
~ Embracing their softer side.
~ Forging the right relationships to drive the right results.
~ Practicing communication mastery.
~ Inspiring others.
~ Building people, not systems.

Among the subtitles discussed are distinctions between the following:

~ providing influence and persuasion vs. giving orders.
~ receiving commitment vs. getting compliance.
~ guiding people's passions vs. doing things my way.

If you would like to move beyond the solitary quest of mastering technology and into a role of providing collaborative, participatory leadership, then consider reading The CIO Edge. Then, practice its principles to develop the people skills needed to drive business growth in the 21st century technology-driven economy.
