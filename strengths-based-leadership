<strong>Strengths Based Leadership</strong> is my early candidate for Best Business Book of 2009.  This is a companion book to <strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/19662217">StrengthsFinder 2.0</a>.</strong>

The value in both books gets created when you use the unique access code provided and take the time to learn about yourself.  This book focuses on providing analysis to those who are in a leadership position or want to be.

If you are in a role that requires you to lead a team or help make a team more productive in some way (who isn't?), then learning more about what makes you and your co-workers tick is vital to enhancing communication and improving productivity.  This book provides solutions.

There are 34 themes/strengths/talents.  Here are my five most dominant:

<strong>Learner</strong>—People who are especially talented in the Learner theme have a great desire to learn and want to continuously improve. In particular, the process of learning, rather than the outcome, excites them.

<strong>Strategic</strong>—People who are especially talented in the Strategic theme create alternative ways to proceed. Faced with any given scenario, they can quickly spot the relevant patterns and issues.

<strong>Analytical</strong>—People who are especially talented in the Analytical theme search for reasons and causes. They have the ability to think about all the factors that might affect a situation.

<strong>Focus</strong>—People who are especially talented in the Focus theme can take a direction, follow through, and make the corrections necessary to stay on track. They prioritize, then act.

<strong>Significance</strong>—People who are especially talented in the Significance theme want to be very important in the eyes of others. They are independent and want to be recognized.

The single point that resonated with me is that being well-rounded breeds mediocrity.  What drives superior team performance is a TEAM that is well rounded with each player on the team contributing different strengths.

Effective leaders surround themselves with the right people and build on each person's strengths.  It is incumbent on the leader to uncover what those strengths are.

Also important for a leader is to understand why people follow.  Gallup's research indicates that followers have four basic needs: trust, compassion, stability and hope.

By having a clear understanding of your strengths and strengths of each team member you interact with you can help provide for the needs of your followers and create a more productive and positive work environment.

A four step plan for maximizing the contents of this book:

1. Read this book
2. Complete the analysis
3. Have teammates complete the <strong>[book:StrengthsFinder 2.0|56454]</strong> analysis
4. Meet weekly to discuss moving toward a strengths-based work team

That's the theory.  Go forth and implement!
