Good ideas come from reading books like Where Good Ideas Come From: The Natural History of Innovation.

This is a book about the space of innovation. The author has identified seven innovation patterns. The more we embrace these patterns, the better we will become at tapping our extraordinary capacity for innovative thinking. He backs these patterns up with a chronology of hundreds of key innovations that have been introduced to the betterment of society over the past five centuries, starting with double-entry accounting.

One of the seven innovation patterns is called The Adjacent Possible. Think of this pattern as a house that magically expands with each door you open. Keep opening new doors and eventually you'll have built a palace. This concept describes the history of evolution and also relates to the process of innovation.

Six additional innovation patterns are identified that help explain how many of the advances in modern society came into being. Generally speaking, good ideas are not conjured out of thin air; they are built out of a collection of existing parts. The history of cultural progress is, almost without exception, a story of one door leading to another door.

We are often better served by connecting ideas than we are by protecting them. That is, open-ended environments tend to foster innovation. Good ideas may not want to be free, but they do want to connect, fuse, recombine. The most productive tool for generating good ideas remains a circle of humans at a table, talking shop.
