It is rare that a business book makes it to a fifth edition, 25 years after its first publication.  This book has staying power.

First, a definition: "Leaders get people moving."

The Leadership Challenge is evidence-based.  It outlines Five Practices that are derived from research.  Here are The Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership:

~ Model the Way
~ Inspire a Shared Vision
~ Challenge the Process
~ Enable Others to Act
~ Encourage the Heart

Statistical analyses reveal that a leader's actions contribute more to such factors as commitment, loyalty, motivation, pride and productivity than does any other single variable.

The Five Practices and Ten Commitments of Exemplary Leadership will help you identify best practices and provide you with a road map to effectively lead any team.

Leaders never get extraordinary things accomplished by themselves.  Leaders mobilize others.  If you are looking for a guidebook of best practices on how to effectively mobilize others, then purchase <strong>[book:The Leadership Challenge: How to Make Extraordinary Things Happen in Organizations|13719932].</strong>  Read its content and execute its advice.  Place it on your work desk and refer to it daily.  The Leadership Challenge stands the test of time.
