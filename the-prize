The Prize uncovers the epic 150-year journey of oil, a dark, smelly substance unearthed in Pennsylvania that would eventually transform nearly every facet of modern civilization.

To summarize this journey in a few short paragraphs would simply fail to grant author Daniel Yergin his well-deserved recognition as the winner of the Pulitzer Prize in 1992 for General Non-Fiction.

Along the way we learn about the rise of the Seven Sisters -- Exxon, Mobil, Chevron, Texaco, Gulf, Royal Dutch/Shell and British Petroleum. We meet opportunists like John D. Rockefeller and J. Paul Getty, evil-doers like Adolf Hitler and Saddam Hussein and heroes like Winston Churchill and Dwight D. Eisenhower.

The 700+ page work of art is both educational and entertaining and quite simply the best history book I've ever read (and I've read perhaps three or four). The Prize successfully captures the essence of why we are the way we are, as a nation and as a society.
