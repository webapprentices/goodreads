This is the story of four politicians brought together under one roof to unite a country during its most turbulent times, the 1860s. The cast of characters:

<b>Abraham Lincoln</b>: a one-term congressman and political underdog.

<b>William Seward</b>: a New York governor and senator who was considered to be a political front-runner.

<b>Salmon Chase</b>: an Ohio senator and governor who was a founding father of the Republican party and felt entitled to become the next president of the United States.

<b>Edward Bates</b>: a Missouri judge and elder statesman who was less enthusiastic about leading the country with a more formal title of President.

All four were nominated by the Republican Party to become the next President in 1960. Lincoln would win the nomination and the presidency. Then, he invited his rivals to join him in leading the country with Seward as Secretary of State, Chase as Secretary of the Treasury and Bates as Attorney General.

The journeys of each man leading up to the election are revealing of character and ambition. The challenges that they faced in resolving issues of slavery and a Civil War were monumental.

I found the retelling of the Civil War to be particularly compelling. The author, a Pulitzer Prize winner for previous historical work, clearly embarked on her own journey to uncover historical documents related to the relationships among the four leading characters. Therein lies my disappointment. I found this masterwork to be overly ambitious in revelation of detail. I lost interest in the minutia, and as a result, placed the book on pause several times. A more consolidated retelling might have more effectively sustained my interest. I would have liked to have rated this book as high as many other have. Alas, I believe my final rating to be fair: I liked it.
