This is the story of four politicians brought together under one roof to unite a country during its most turbulent times, the 1860s. The cast of characters:

Abraham Lincoln: a one-term congressman and political underdog.

William Seward: a New York senator and governor who was considered to be a political front-runner.

Salmon Chase: an Ohio senator and governor who was a founding father of the Republican party and felt entitled to become the next president of the United States.

Edward Bates: a Missouri judge and elder statesman who was less enthusiastic about leading the country with a more formal formal title of President.

All four were nominated by the Republican Party to become the next President in 1960. Lincoln would win the nomination and the presidency. Then he invited his rivals to join him in leading the country with Seward as Secretary of State, Chase as Secretary of the Treasury and Bates as Attorney General.
