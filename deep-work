The author defines Deep Work as "professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate."

Shallow Work, by contrast, has become the norm. Shallow Work activities include reading and answering e-mails which consume an estimated 30 percent of a knowledge worker's time!

To remain valuable in our economy -- especially an economy that is relentlessly moving toward automation and the elimination of routine work and the termination of average workers -- one must master the art of quickly learning complicated things. If you don't, you are likely to fall behind as technology advances.

Among the destroyers of Deep Work are instant messaging, social media and open-office floor plans. A workday driven by the shallow is likely to be a draining and upsetting day. Distraction has costs and depth has value. The key to developing a Deep Work habit is to add routines and rituals to your working life designed to minimize distraction and maximize sustained concentration.

Two of my favorite books referenced in Deep Work are the following:

~ Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity

~ The 4 Disciplines of Execution: Achieving Your Wildly Important Goals

Deep Work is "the superpower of the 21st century" and Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World deserves its ranking as one of the Best Business Books of 2016.
