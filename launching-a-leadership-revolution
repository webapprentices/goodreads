This book is my early favorite for Best Business Book of the 2008. It also wins my prestigious Yellow Highlighter Award -- I have highlights and stars on virtually every page!

The authors walk readers through The Five Levels of Influence:

Level 1 Leaders are only as good as what they learn.

Level 2 Leaders are only as good as their personal performance.

Level 3 Leaders are only as good as the performance of their team.

Level 4 Leaders are only as good as the performance of their leaders.

Level 5 Leaders are only as good as the enduring quality and succession of their vision.

Any one who is fortunate enough to have to work for a living will benefit from this book. If you happen to work with others then you are presented with leadership opportunities daily. The clearly written, positive strategies detailed in this book will help you understand your current level of influence and help shine a light on the steps you need to take to increase your leadership influence.
