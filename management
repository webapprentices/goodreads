No manager worth her weight should be allowed to manage people, projects or businesses without a fundamental understanding of the teachings of <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Drucker" target="_blank">Peter Drucker</a>,</strong> The Man Who Invented Management.  <strong>Management</strong> captures a lifetime of Drucker's principles in one legacy guide book on the practice of management.

The original text was published in 1973.  This revised edition integrates Drucker's findings from then until his passing in 2005 at age 95.  At more than 500 pages it is comprehensive, yet easy to read.  The material has stood the test of time remarkably well.

While many of us consider ourselves "knowledge workers" in the Internet age, it was Drucker who coined the termâ€”in 1959!  The forward by Jim Collins puts this work into context: "The very best leaders are first and foremost effective managers."  This book provides the road map to becoming effective in the workplace.

Here are five nuggets that capture the essence of this work:

~ "One can divide the work of a manager into planning, organizing, integrating, measuring and developing people."  Yet, how many of us excel at each of these tasks on a weekly basis, especially the responsibility of developing people?

~ "Not to innovate is the single largest reason for the decline of existing organizations.  Not to know how to manage is the single largest reason for the failure of new ventures."  Yet, what innovation have we introduced into our organization in the past 30 days, in the past 12 months?

~ In the industrial society schooling traditionally stopped when work began.  In the knowledge society, it never stops.  "The fastest-growing industry in any developed country may turn out to be the continuing education of already well-educated adults."  Yet, how many of us have a plan for continuous learning?

~ "The most effective way to manage change successfully is to create it.  This requires the organized abandonment of things that have been shown to be unsuccessful, and the organized and continuous improvement of every product, service, and process within the enterprise."  Yet, how many of us can identify one product, service or process improvement we've contributed to our organization over the past 30 days, over the past 12 months?

~ "One does not 'manage' people.  The task is to lead people.  And the goal is to make productive the specific strengths and knowledge of each individual."  Yet, how many of us know our own strengths, not to mention the strengths of those we work with?

Five nuggets and I haven't summarized more than the first 80 pages!

The modern workplace needs our help and the practice of management begins with each of us.  How well we manage ourselves is a reasonable indicator of how well we might manage others, and "the very best leaders are first and foremost effective managers."

Buy this book, read it cover to cover, place it on your desk at work and refer to it daily!
