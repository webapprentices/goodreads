Extensive research demonstrates that people with rich networks achieve higher performance ratings, get promoted faster and earn more money.  The premise of this book is simple: If you want to develop a rich network, be a giver, not a taker.

A few nuggets of wisdom ...

~ pronoia (opposite of paranoia) -- the delusional belief that other people are plotting your well-being, or saying nice things about you behind your back.

~ five-minute favor -- willingness to do something that will take you five minutes or less for anybody.

~ expedition behavior -- putting the group's goals and mission first, and showing the same amount of concern for others as you do for yourself.

~ responsibility bias -- exaggerating our own contributions relative to others' inputs.

~ information discrepancy -- having more access to information about our own contributions than the contributions of others.

Of the stories presented that expound on these concepts, I found the look inside the player personnel decisions of the Portland Trail Blazers to be most interesting.

I also found the research about volunteerism to be enlightening.  In particular, the 100-hour rule of volunteering (two hours a week) appears to be the optimal level where giving is maximally energizing and minimally draining. It is most effective to chunk this time as opposed to sprinkle it throughout the week. 

Conclusion: successful givers get to the top without cutting others down, finding ways of expanding the pie that benefit themselves and the people around them.
