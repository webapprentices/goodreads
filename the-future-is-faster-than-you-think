This book explores how technologies are converging to disrupt the future. Specifically, exponentially accelerating technologies are doubling in power while dropping in price on a regular basis. Whenever a new technology offers a tenfold increase in value—cheaper, faster and better—there's little that can slow it down.

An invention that creates a new market is referred to as a "disruptive innovation." A paradigm-shifting technology example would be silicon chips replacing vacuum tubes. From a business perspective the application of disruptive technology leads to a business disruption like the one witnessed when Netflix replaced Blockbuster.

Exponential technology topics discussed include the following: quantum computing, machine learning, artificial intelligence, Internet of Things, LIDAR, robotics, virtual and augmented reality, 3-D printing, digital currencies, blockchain, nanotechnology, CRISPR, and more.

The authors focus on exploring technology disruptions within industry segments including the following: shopping, advertising, entertainment, education, healthcare, longevity, finance and food.

<strong>The Future is Faster Than You Think</strong> because these technology breakthroughs are converging and the resulting collision is accelerating the pace of innovation. The practical implication of this acceleration is that new jobs will be created for some and current jobs will disappear for many.

The one discussion that might be lacking in this exploration is the perspective of the consequences to society as a result of these exponentially accelerating technologies. Surely, there will be downsides, as well as, unintended consequences.

Nonetheless, here is a perspective to contemplate: At the beginning of the 20th century, many of the more privileged people on Planet Earth did not have air-conditioning, running water, indoor plumbing, automobiles, refrigerators, telephones or computers. What "conveniences" will our children's children access in the near future that we can only contemplate today in the form of science fiction?
