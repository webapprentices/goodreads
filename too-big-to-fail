<p>An epic inside look at the high-stakes battle to save the global economy from entering another Great Depression.</p><p>In 2008, the Big Five investment banks either failed (Lehman Brothers), were sold (Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch) or converted into bank holding companies (Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley). How did this happen? Why did this happen? What were the consequences and ramifications if these actions were not taken?</p><p>The Federal Reserve, the Department of the Treasury and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York were in the spotlight during the greatest financial crisis the United States faced since the Great Depression. Top executives at the Big Five, as well as, other large financial institutions comprise the cast of characters that populate this power play. So many characters, in fact, that the author provides an eight-age roster at the beginning of the book to help the reader keep score. Therein lies a significant flaw in following the twists and turns in this epic tale of a fleet of financial supertankers sailing toward the edge of a flat-earth financial free fall.</p><p>Three central characters — <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7098979-on-the-brink" target="_blank"><strong>Hank Paulson</strong><a/>, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25622135-the-courage-to-act" target="_blank"><strong>Ben Bernanke</strong></a> and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19524269-stress-test" target="_blank"><strong>Tim Geithner</strong></a> — have since offered their own insights into this historic financial rescue, which indicates that this challenge was indeed <strong>Too Big to Fail</strong>.
