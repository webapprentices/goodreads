<p>An epic inside look at the high-stakes battle to save the global economy from entering another Great Depression.</p>

<p>In 2008, the Big Five investment banks either failed (Lehman Brothers), were sold (Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch) or converted into bank holding companies (Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley). How did this happen? Why did this happen? What were the consequences and ramifications if these actions were taken?</p>

<p>The Federal Reserve, The Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York were in the spotlight during the greatest financial crisis the United States faced since the Great Depression. Top executives at the Big Five, as well as, other large financial institutions are the cast of characters that form this passion play. Too many characters to mention. Too many actors to keep track of. Therein lies the only flaw in the epic tale of the edge of a global financial meltdown.</p>

<p>Three central characters in this retrospective — <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7098979-on-the-brink" target="_blank"><strong>Hank Paulson</strong><a/>, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25622135-the-courage-to-act" target="_blank"><strong>Ben Bernanke</strong></a> and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19524269-stress-test" target="_blank"><strong>Tim Geithner</strong></a> — have since offered their own insights into this historic financial rescue, which indicates that this challenge was indeed <strong>Too Big to Fail</strong>. This book has earned its spot on the list of <a href="https://beantownweb.blogspot.com/2010/01/best-business-books-2009.html" target="_blank"><strong>Best Business Books of 2009</strong><a/>.</p>
