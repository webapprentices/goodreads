This book is my third and final candidate for best business book I read in 2009.  The first two were:

[book:Strengths-Based Leadership|5973885]
[book:Talent is Overrated|4485966]

This book resonated with me because of my current role as technology instructor.  I am challenged almost daily with presenting sometimes complex concepts to design students who sometimes respond that they don't understand by stating "I'm a visual person."

This book helped me appreciate the value of telling a story with pictures and how to ask the right question to arrive at the appropriate picture to help visualize the concept.

The first assessment helps you determine the type of visual thinker you are as follows:

~ black pen ("Hand me the pen!")
~ yellow pen ("I can't draw, but...")
~ red pen ("I'm not visual")

I identified myself as a yellow pen visual thinker which places me in the middle of more creative types (black pen thinkers) and more analytical types (red pen thinkers).

The principles presented to help sell your ideas with pictures require practice.  For example, I find it easier to write a proposal or a blog article, than to come up with the right image to help convey that same message visually.  This book provides guidance on how best to create images that sell ideas.

Practice is one theme that is woven throughout the three books I've selected as Best of 2009.  [book:Strengths-Based Leadership|5973885] helps you identify your strengths, but practice allows you to capitalize on your strengths.  [book:Talent is Overrated|4485966] reminds us that long hours of practice can help us achieve important life goals long after others have given up and settled for less.

And for this reason I select [book:Talent is Overrated|4485966] as the best business-related book I read in 2009!
