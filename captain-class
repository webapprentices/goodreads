The focus of <b>The Captain Class</b> is team sports. In particular, this thoughtfully-researched book explores the factors that create and perpetuate elite teams that exhibited multiple years of superior performance and championship success.

The rigid criteria that the author applied to identify elite teams narrowed the research focus to 16 teams across professional team sports including baseball, basketball, hockey, football, soccer, rugby, volleyball, field hockey and handball. 

The question that the author wanted to answer was "What do the most dominant teams in history have in common?"

Think elite teams and you typically envision superstars performing at peak levels. For example the Boston Celtics won 11 championships between 1956 and 1969.  Bill Russell and Bob Cousy stand out among many talented members of those teams. Yet, in seven of its eleven championship seasons, the team didn't place a single scorer in the top ten in league statistics. So, something other than individual performance is at play. What makes a team better than the sum of its parts?

Answer: The Captains

Throughout much of the book, discussions revolve around The Seven Traits of Elite Captains. One example is "a willingness to do thankless jobs in the shadows." Another is "motivates others with passionate nonverbal displays."

A few takeaways:

~ A team is more likely to become elite if it has a captain that leads from the shadows.

~ The best teams had clusters of above-average (though not necessarily star) performers.

~ Spending the most money on players doesn't guarantee titles.

~ Coaches don't win many games.

One potential flaw in this research is the omission of several teams that many American sports fans might consider to be elite, including the Green Bay Packers of the 1960s, the Chicago Bulls of the 1990s and the New England Patriots of the 2000s. Rationale is offered in each case for these seeming oversights. Nonetheless, inclusion of teams that most Americans might not be familiar with, such as New Zealand rugby, Brazilian soccer and Australian field hockey make for an informative read.
