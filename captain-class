The focus of <b>The Captain Class</b> is team sports. In particular, this thoughtfully-researched book explores the factors that create and perpetuate elite teams that exhibited multiple years of years of superior performance and championship success.

The rigid criteria that the author applied to identify elite teams narrowed the research focus to 16 teams across popular professional team sports including baseball, basketball, hockey, football, soccer, rugby and handball. 

The question that the author wanted to answer was "What to the most dominant team in history have in common?" The result was seven core qualities that define the Captain Class.

Think elite teams and you typically envision superstars performing at peak levels within their their sport. For example the Boston Celtics won 11 championships between 1956 and 1969.  Bill Russell and Bob Cousy stand out among many talented members of those teams. Yet, in seven of its eleven championship seasons, the team didn't place a single scorer in the top ten in overall league statistics. So, something else is at play than merely individual performance.
