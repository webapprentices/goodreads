To paraphrase Gordon Gekko ... <blockquote><strong>"Change, for lack of a better word, is good."</strong></blockquote>This is a  book about change; and change begins with changing habits—breaking bad habits and developing good ones. While this is a book about personal change, the guidelines presented can also be applied to the workplace. When enough individuals within a culture change habits, the culture changes.


Changes that seem small and unimportant at first will compound into remarkable results if you're willing to stick with them for years. I make it a habit to read, first thing in the morning, a few pages from highly recommended business books. I read before turning on any electronic devices. This atomic habit, initiated years ago, has resulted in my library of business knowledge.
