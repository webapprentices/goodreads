To paraphrase Gordon Gekko ... <blockquote><strong>"Change, for lack of a better word, is good."</strong></blockquote>This is a  book about change; and change begins with changing habitsâ€”both bad habits and good ones. While this is a book about personal change, the guidelines presented can also be applied to the workplace. When individuals within a culture change habits, the culture changes.
