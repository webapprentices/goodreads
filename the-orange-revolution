This is a book about carrots, the authors' catchphrase for employee recognition.  In particular, the term "Orange" is used to describe the overall characteristics, rules and behaviors of great teams.

Leaders of Orange Teams that achieve enhanced business results are generally seen as stronger in the following four areas:

~ goal setting (knowing where you are going)
~ communication (wise use of your voice and ears)
~ trust (believing in others and being trustworthy)
~ accountability (doing what you say you will do)

When leaders combined these Basic 4 leadership characteristics with frequent purposed-based recognition, return on equity was more than three times higher than expected, and team morale was more than twice as high.

Recognition is a powerful accelerant to The Basic 4.  It's a divider between good teams and great teams.  In fact, the number one reason people leave organizations is that they don't feel appreciated.

The Basic 4 + Recognition characterizes the "softer" side of business, the side that matters most to most people.  

This book would have been a success had the key take-home points stopped at The Basic 4 + Recognition.  However, the authors went one step further to introduce The Rule of 3:

~ Wow (commit to a standard of world-class performance)
~ No surprises (all team members are accountable and each member knows what to expect from the others)
~ Cheer (team members cheer others and the group on to victory)

An additional chapter lists 101 Ways to Bring Your Team Together.

While this additional information is useful and practical it tends to distract from the core message of The Basic 4 + Recognition.

Bottom line: We all work harder when someone is paying attention to our efforts.  If you are in a leadership role, pay attention -- daily.  If you are a member of a team, pay attention -- daily.  Recognize the members of your team and cheer for your teammates -- daily.  The Orange Revolution begins with you.
