Simplicity is the take-home message in this highly accessible rework of the world of work.  This is a book of gems.  Here are my baker's dozen favorites:

~ "A business without a path to profit isn't a business, it's a hobby."

~ "Build half a product, not a half-assed product."

~ "Find a judo solution, one that delivers maximum efficiency with minimum effort."

~ "Momentum fuels motivation.  The way to build momentum is by getting something done and then moving on the the next thing."

~ "Use the power of no to get your priorities straight."

~ "All companies have customers.  Lucky companies have fans.  But the most fortunate companies have audiences."

~ Speak, write, blog, tweet, makes videos — whatever.  Share information that's valuable and you'll slowly but surely build an audience."

~ Don't be afraid to give a little away for free — as long as you've got something else to sell."

~ "How long someone's been doing it is overrated.  What matters is how <i>well</i> they've been doing it."

~ "Managers of one are people who come in with their own goals and execute them.  They don't need heavy direction."

~ "Getting back to people quickly is probably the most important thing you can do when it comes to customer service."

~ "A lot of companies post help-wanted ads seeking 'rock stars' or 'ninjas.'  Lame."

~ "There are four-letter words you should never use in business: need, must, can't, easy, just, only, and fast.  And ASAP is poison!"

So, you <strong>must</strong> go out and purchase this book <strong>ASAP</strong>.  I <strong>can't</strong> say enough about how this book will change your life.  It is an <strong>easy</strong> read and can be completed <strong>fast</strong> in a few sittings. This is the <strong>only</strong> book you'll ever need. <strong>Just</strong> trust me.

Lame!  Rock stars and ninjas don't need a hard sell.
