There are only two ways to influence human behavior: you can manipulate it or you can inspire it.  A popular manipulation is dropping the price.  For the seller of a product or a service, selling on price is like heroin: the more you do it, the harder it becomes to kick the habit.

Manipulations work.  While manipulations may influence repeat business, they do not breed loyalty.  And it is in the tough times that loyal customers matter most.  This book is about taking the higher road: inspiring customers (and employees) by Starting with Why.

The author introduces the concept of <strong><a href="https://youtu.be/MNSAolUgFYQ" target="_blank">The Golden Circle</a></strong>â€”three concentric circles labeled What, How and Why with Why at the center.  By Why the author means "what is your purpose, cause or belief."  Why should anyone care about your company?  Knowing Why is essential for lasting success and the ability to avoid being lumped with others.

Inspired companies (and leaders) communicate from the inside out.  They Start with Why.  Company examples used throughout the book include Apple, Southwest Airlines, Harley-Davidson, Walmart, Microsoft, Starbucks and Disney.

Most companies have no idea Why their customers are their customers.  Odds are good that they also don't know Why their employees are their employees either.

The goal of business should not be to do business with anyone who simply wants what you have.  It should be to focus on the people who believe what you believe.  The goal of a hiring manager should not be to hire people who have a skill set you need, but rather to hire people who believe what you believe.
