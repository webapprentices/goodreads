<p><b>Evicted</b> shines a light on eight real-life families. Many of the family members face "compounded limitations" in their daily struggle to merely survive in big-city America.</p><p>~ Three examples of this compounding effect:</p><p>~ "Job loss could lead to eviction, but the reverse was also true."</p><p>~ "Ned was out of cigarettes because Pam was smoking more to offset stress and hunger pains."</p><p>~ "[Pam] was beginning to wonder what was most responsible for keeping them homeless: her drug conviction from several years back, the fact that Ned was on the run and had no proof of income, their eviction record, their poverty, or their children."</p><p>Clearly, we have challenges to overcome as a society. Eviction is a cause, not just a condition, of poverty. Without decent, affordable housing, everything else falls apart.</p>
