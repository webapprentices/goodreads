This is a story about eight real-life families. Many of the family members face "compounded limitations" in their daily struggle to merely survive.

Three examples: 

~ "Job loss could lead to eviction, but the reverse was also true."

~ "Ned was out of cigarettes because Pam was smoking more to offset stress and hunger pains."

~ "[Pam] was beginning to wonder what was most responsible for keeping them homeless: her drug conviction from several years back, the fact that Ned was on the run and had no proof of income, their eviction record, their poverty, or their children."

Clearly, we have challenges to overcome as a society. Eviction is a cause, not just a condition, of poverty. Without decent, affordable housing, everything else fall apart.
