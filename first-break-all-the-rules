<blockquote>"The <i>only</i> way to generate enduring profits is to begin by building the kind of work environment that attracts, focuses and keeps talented employees."</blockquote>This book offers a blueprint to becoming a high-valued manager based on interviews with more than one million employees.

The research boils down to twelve questions that offer the simplest and most accurate way to measure the strength of a workforce.  How employees answer these questions determines how effective the organization's managers are at their craft.  None of these questions deal with pay, benefits, senior management or organizational structure.  All of these questions deal with four outcomes that all businesses want: productivity, profitability, employee retention and customer satisfaction.

If you are a manager, start by working daily to secure high scores from every member of your team on each of these six questions:

~ Do I know what is expected of me at work?
~ Do I have the materials and equipment I need to do my work right?
~ Do I have the opportunity to do what I do best every day?
~ In the last seven days, have I received recognition or praise for good work?
~ Does my supervisor, or someone at work, seem to care about me as a person?
~ Is there someone at work who encourages my development?

A manager's role is that of "catalyst."  The four activities that a manager must perform extremely well are as follows:

~ select a person (select for talent)
~ set expectations (define the right outcomes)
~ motivate the person (focus on strengths)
~ develop the person (find the right fit)

If you cannot perform these four activities well, you will never excel as a manager.

The most insightful discussion here focuses on talent, which is "a recurring pattern of thought, feeling or behavior that can be productively applied."  To adequately explore "talent" consider reading a companion book, <strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/44201895">Strengths Based Leadership</a>.</strong>

That's it.  That's all you need to know.  Now, go execute!
