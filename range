<p>This book refutes the "deliberate practice" framework and the "10,000 hours" rule for success that have been popular for the past decade or so. Deliberate practice requires focused attention and is conducted with the specific goal of improving performance. The principle holds that 10,000 hours of "deliberate practice" are needed to become world-class in any field.</p>

<p>This framework is especially valued in solitary activities such as athletics (golf), music (classical instruments) and non-sport activities (chess). The author defines these as "kind" learning environments where the rules are relatively simple and known, and there is a close relationship between effort and outcome or result. Most real-world activities, however, involve "wicked" learning environments where spontaneity and unpredictability are present and experience doesn’t necessarily correlate with success.</p>

<p>As society evolves into a more artificial intelligence phase of development, we encounter Moravec's paradox where machines and humans frequently have opposite strengths and weaknesses. Might we be better served if machines take on more of the "kind" learning roles that they can be programmed to excel at? For example, computers can now regularly defeat humans at chess.</p>

<p>The brings us to "range." The greatest strength of human is the exact opposite of narrow specialization in kind environments. Rather, it is the ability to integrate broadly. Range is a more diverse experience across multiple fields</p>

<p>The author shares a wide variety of stories, interviews, research studies and anecdotes to support the value of developing range.</p>
