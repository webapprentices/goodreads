<p>This book attempts to refute the "deliberate practice" framework and the "10,000 hours" rule for success that have been popular for the past decade or so. Deliberate practice requires focused attention and is conducted with the specific goal of improving performance. The principle holds that 10,000 hours of "deliberate practice" are needed to become world-class in any field.</p>

<p>This framework is especially valued in solitary activities such as athletics (golf), music (classical instruments) and non-sport activities (chess). The author defines these as "kind" learning environments where the rules are relatively simple and known, and there is a close relationship between effort and outcome or result. Most real world activities involve "wicked" learning environments where there is a lot of spontaneity and unpredictability involved and experience doesnâ€™t necessarily correlate with success.</p>
