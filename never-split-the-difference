Life is a series of negotiations. While the focus of this book is hostage negotiations, the author translates his observations and methods to help readers apply these techniques to everyday situations. After all, kidnappers are just businessmen trying to get the best price.

It all starts with the universally applicable premise that people want to be understood and accepted. It all starts with listening. Negotiation is nothing more than communication with results. Many people have an aversion to negotiating. You don't need to like it; you just need to understand that's how the world works.

To negotiate successfully, it is critical to prepare. The author offers a valuable Negotiation One Sheet to guide you through the preparation process.
