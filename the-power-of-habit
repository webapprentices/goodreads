Habits are the choices that all of us deliberately make at some point, and stop thinking about but continue doing, often every day.  We stop making a choice and the behavior becomes automatic.

Individuals have habits.  Companies have habits.  Even societies have habits.

The process begins by understanding The Habit Loop:

~ Cue
~ Routine
~ Reward

For example, studies of people who have successfully started new exercise routines show that they are more likely to stick with a workout plan if they chose a specific cue (run as soon as I get home from work) and a clear reward (an evening of guilt-free television).

One additional ingredient drives the loop: a craving (a mild obsession).

Once you break a habit into its components, you can fiddle with the gears.  Once you see everything as bunch of habits, it's like someone gave you a flashlight and a crowbar, and you can get to work.

I found the discussions about organizational habits most interesting: Bill Wilson and Alcoholics Anonymous, Tony Dungy and the Indianapolis Colts, Paul O'Neill and Alcoa.  They focused on changing one habit—a keystone habit—that rippled throughout the organization triggering widespread change.

The chapter on how Target knows what you want before you do will introduce you to the value of predictive analytics and how to profit from consumer habits.  It's "pregnancy-prediction machine" is a fascinating application of big data.

The dark side of predictive analytics is revealed in a story about Harrah's Entertainment (now Caesars Entertainment) and their ability to fuel the craving that gamblers share: the desire to win.  Full Disclosure: I once worked for Holiday Corporation, the former parent of Harrah's Entertainment.

Bottom line: We chose our habits (mostly), once we know how.  Knowing how is the focus of this book.  Individuals can benefit.  Business leaders can benefit by knowing how to influence individual habits and thus alter organizational performance.  This book deserves five stars and should be on every manager's short list of books to read.
