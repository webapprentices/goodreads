Introducing my second nomination for Best Business Book of 2009. My first recommendation was <strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/44201895">Strengths-Based Leadership</a>.</strong>

<strong>Talent Is Overrated</strong> was written by Geoff Colvin.  If you are a regular reader of FORTUNE you'll recognize Geoff's contributions to business analysis.

<strong>Talent Is Overrated</strong> covers similar territory as Malcolm Gladwell's <strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/44202392">Outliers</a>.</strong>  Both books even reference The Beatles' early rise from Liverpool/Hamburg obscurity.  Whereas Gladwell's approach is more engaging and anecdotal, Colvin's is more focused and analytical.

Colvin begins by stating an apparent truism that many of us recognize but rarely think about.  Many workers spend years at the same job, but don't appear to reach a level of superior performance.  Colvin delves into the research and uncovers the primary cause: lack of "deliberate practice."  Deliberate practice is an activity designed specifically to improve performance.  It is highly demanding mentally, and it isn't much fun.  Tons of deliberate practice equals great performance.

Deliberate practice is so intense that it's exhausting and not inherently enjoyable.  Most people don't rise to the level of great performance because they avoid deliberate practice.  And most organizations are terrible at structuring an environment designed to support deliberate practice.

Much of the discussion focuses on sports (Jerry Rice, Tiger Woods) and music (Mozart, The Beatles).  But what about high achieving business leaders (John D. Rockefeller, Warren Buffett, Jack Welch, Bill Gates)?  Deliberate practice leads to building and developing "domain specific" knowledge.  In a knowledge-based economy, deliberate practice leads to superior performance.

Organizations large and small will continue to pursue high achievers to help their businesses succeed, especially in a globally competitive, information-based, 24/7 economy.  Workers who want to get ahead and leaders who want their organizations to be "best in class" should learn more about the principles of well-structured deliberate practice.  <strong>Talent is Overrated</strong> offers a business plan.  You must provide the execution.
