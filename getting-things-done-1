GTD is the acronym among rabid fans for this productivity system.  I count myself among this group (11,000 Facebook Fans and growing).  Even though the book was first published in 2001, <strong>Getting Things Done</strong> is my early candidate for Best Business Book of 2010.

Where to begin?  Well, this is the question that GTD helps you get answers to.  If you feel like you are spinning your wheels at work or in life, then GTD will pave the road to provide traction.

At the core of GTD is getting organized.  Plan to spend two days—yes, two whole days—doing nothing but organizing your "stuff."  It might be the most productive two days you will ever spend.

Here are a few components of the stress-free productivity process:

~ the five-stage method for managing workflow: collect, process, organize, review and do.

~ the five phases of project planning: purpose, principles, outcome visioning, brainstorming and organizing followed by the next action that you need to take to move the project forward.

The power of this productivity system lies in the following three components:

~ the collection habit
~ next action decisions
~ outcome focusing

The glue that holds the process together is the Weekly Review.

If your life feels like "an amorphous blob of undoability" then GTD might provide you with answers.  It has for me.
