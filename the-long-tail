The Long Tail is nothing more than infinite choice.  The book describes the forces that are turning an unlimited number of unprofitable customers, products, and markets into profitable ones.

This book details how the Internet has transformed society from a broadcast orientation -- one show to millions of people -- to the opposite -- a million shows to one person each.

A "hit" is a TV show (or a movie, or a CD) that attracts an unusually large audience.  Everything that is not a blockbuster hit gets labeled as a "miss."  Instead, we should think of non-blockbusters, not in terms of failure, but, rather, as "everything else."  Today, we have hits and niches.

The Internet has created an infinite number of niche markets where "everything else" can be delivered efficiently and profitably to the vast majority of everybody else not looking for the blockbuster hit.

Business examples are presented from industries mostly affected by this phenomenon, including television, theatrical film, recording arts, and book publishing, to name a few.

So, how do the creators of "everything else" reach "everybody else" and make a profit?  Through the use of filter mechanisms.  Examples include the following:

- create rankings within niche categories
- post user reviews and recommendations

The book concludes with nine rules for creating a thriving Long Tail business and the following two-point summary:

1. make everything available
2. help me find it

My take-home point...

We all live in a Long Tail world.  To thrive in this chaotic environment make as much quality information about yourself and the services you provide as available as possible, then help people find this information.
