Thomas Friedman's "green revolution" follow-up to <strong>[book:The World is Flat|4271]</strong> is full of aha! moments.  Here are just a few . . .

~ CO2 stays in the atmosphere for several thousand years.  It's Mother Nature's operating system.

~ The United States and China release the most amount of greenhouse gases (no surprise), followed by Indonesia and Brazil (surprise).  Why?  The cutting and clearing of forests.

~ The CO2 emissions from deforestation are greater than the emissions from the world's entire transportation sector—all the cars, trucks, planes, trains, and ships combined.

~ If you shut down the whole transportation system, and another vehicle never moved on planet earth, you reduce carbon emissions by 14 percent, globally.

~ A car that is idling produces twenty times the pollution that a car going 30 miles an hour does.

~ The production of cement worldwide releases almost as much CO2 into the atmosphere as all the passenger cars in the world.

~ Oceans are the lungs of the world, storing and exhaling CO2.  Raise the temperature > melt some ice > release some CO2 > raise the temperature > the cycle continues.

Friedman details how we got here, how we move forward, and why America and China must lead the way if we expect our planet to survive in the long run.  We must begin yesterday.  A crisis is a terrible thing to waste.
