What an audacious goal: write A Brief History of Humankind. What an audacious success!

Animals much like modern humans first appeared about 2.5 million years ago. Biologists classify organisms into species. Species that evolved from a common ancestor are organized under the heading of genus. <i>Homo sapiens</i> belong to the species <i>sapiens</i> (wise) of the genus <i>Homo</i> (man).

<i>Homo sapiens</i>, like all animals, belong to a family. Our family is called the great apes. About 6 million years ago, a single female ape had two daughters. One became the ancestor of all chimpanzees. The other can be referred to by <i>Homo sapiens</i> as "grandma."

This is the story of <i>sapiens</i>.
