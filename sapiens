What an audacious goal: write A Brief History of Humankind. What an audacious success!

Animals much like modern humans first appeared about 2.5 million years ago. Biologists classify organisms into species. Species that evolved from a common ancestor are organized under the heading of genus. <i>Homo sapiens</i> belong to the species <i>sapiens</i> (wise) of the genus <i>Homo</i> (man).

<i>Homo sapiens</i>, like all animals, belong to a family. <i>Homo sapiens</i> belong to a family called the great apes. About 6 million years ago, a single female ape had two daughters. One became the ancestor of all chimpanzees. The other can be referred to by <i>Homo sapiens</i> as "grandma."

<i>Homo sapiens</i> had at least five distinct cousins including <i>Homo erectus</i> and <i>Homo neanderthalensis</i> (aka Neanderthals). These cousins can all be referred to a "humans." However, not all of the cousins got along. It turns out that tolerance is not a <i>Homo sapiens</i> trademark. The cousins disappeared, and over the past 10,000 years ,<i>Homo sapiens</i> have been the only human species.

The bulk of this emploration covers the following three developmental periods:

<b>The Cognitive Revolution</b> (between 70,000 and 30,000 years ago) featured new ways of thinking and communicating. Legends, myths, gods and religions appear for the first time.
