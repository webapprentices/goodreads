The subtitle of this book should read "The Psychology of Manipulation."

I decided to read this book because I've seen it listed on several <strong><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/learning/best-business-books-according-to-goodreads" target="_blank">"Best of" business book lists</a></strong> throughout the years. Originally published in 1984, and revised in 1993, the concepts and examples do feel dated. Nonetheless, the presentation offers valuable insights into consumer behavior.

The experimental social psychology research centers around the core question of what factors cause one person to say yes to another person. The author organizes the material around six principles (and six chapters) as follows:

~ Reciprocation
~ Commitment and Consistency
~ Social Proof
~ Liking
~ Authority
~ Scarcity

These factors (weapons of influence) help determine a person's willingness to say yes without thinking first.

Here are three key research findings that I found to be as timely today as they were in the pre-internet era:

~ When we ask someone to do us a favor we will be more successful if we provide a reason. People simply like to have reasons for what they do.

~ The rule of reciprocation states that we should try to repay, in kind, what another person has provided us.

~ Public commitments tend to be lasting commitments. Set a goal and <em>write it down.</em>

Each of the six influence chapters features a closing <strong>How to Say No</strong> section. <strong>Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion</strong> offers the reader solid advice on understanding the influence technique that may be in use and, most importantly, guidance on how to guard against being manipulated.
