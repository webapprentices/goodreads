The subtitle of this book should read "The Psychology of Manipulation."

I decided to read this book because I've seen it listed on several "Best of" business book lists throughout the years. Originally published in 1984 and revised in 1993, the concepts and examples do feel dated. Nonetheless, the presentation offers valuable insights into consumer behavior.
