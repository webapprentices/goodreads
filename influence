The subtitle of this book should read "The Psychology of Manipulation."

I decided to read this book because I've seen it listed on several "Best of" business book lists throughout the years. Originally published in 1984 and revised in 1993, the concepts and examples do feel dated. Nonetheless, the presentation offers valuable insights into consumer behavior.

The experimental social psychology research centers around the core question of what factors cause one person to say yes to another person. The author organizes the material around six principles as follows:

~ consistency
~ reciprocation
~ social proof
~ authority
~ liking
~ scarcity

These factors influence a person's willingness to say yes without thinking first.
