Pixar has created some of the most beloved films in recent memory.  This is the story behind the making of these 14 computer-animated movies and the explanation offered for the culture of success that spawned these creative endeavors.

Steve Jobs comes to mind when Pixar is mentioned.  He took Pixar public after the release of Toy Story and profited handsomely.  However, Steve's involvement was more financial and much less hands-on then at his masterwork, Apple.  

This story is told through the eyes of Ed Catmull, one of the co-founders of Pixar and current President of Walt Disney and Pixar Animation Studios.

A few key take-home points:

~ If you give a good idea to a mediocre team, they will screw it up.  If you give a mediocre idea to a brilliant team, they will either fix it or throw it away and come up with something better.

~ Find, develop and support good people, and they will find, develop and own good ideas.

~ Quality is the best business plan.

~ A hallmark of a healthy, creative culture is that its people feel free to share ideas, opinions and criticisms.

~ We believe that ideas—and thus, films—only become great when they are challenged and tested.

~ If there is more truth in the hallways than in meetings, you have a problem.

~ Mistakes aren't a necessary evil.  They aren't evil at all.  They are the inevitable consequence of doing something new.

~ The goal is to uncouple fear and failure—to create an environment in which making mistakes doesn't strike terror into your employees' hearts.

~ If there is fear, there is a reason—our job is to find the reason and to remedy it.

~ Getting middle managers to tolerate (and not feel threatened by) problems and surprises is one of our most important jobs.

~ One of the most crucial responsibilities of leadership is creating a culture that rewards those who lift not just our stock prices but our aspirations as well.

The stories told and the lessons learned resonate with the casual reader, as well as, the student of corporate culture.  The Afterward—The Steve We Knew—provided a fitting close to an informative and educational business book.  Ed Catmull worked with Steve Jobs for twenty-six years, longer than perhaps anyone else.  The author offers insights into Jobs' genius.  A fitting close ...
