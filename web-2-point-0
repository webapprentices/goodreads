Web 2.0 describes the current movement beyond the creation of static Web pages (brochureware) to developing dynamic Web environments that take advantage of network effects.  "When people come together over the Web, their efforts are multiplied rather than simply added together."

<strong>Web 2.0: A Strategy Guide</strong> pledges that you'll learn how to make money by monetizing the network effects the Web makes possible.  While the book falls somewhat short of this pledge, it provides a comprehensive business analysis of many of the organizations that are commonly referred to as Web 2.0 companies.  These include Google, Facebook, Flickr, LinkedIn and others.

One feature that the author presents at the end of each chapter that I found particularly helpful is a list of Tactical Questions that business managers can offer up for discussion to help facilitate the movement of any business toward implementing Web 2.0 business model features.  The author also conveniently concludes the book with a five-step action plan for business managers to use for embedding Web 2.0 strategies into current operations.

This review was written on the day that the Wall Street Journal launched Journal Community, a social networking component to their online business operations.  If you are a business manager (entrepreneur, independent contractor), can you afford not to develop a deeper understanding of Web 2.0 and its potential impact on your business operations?
