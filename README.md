<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Goodreads</strong></a> is the world's largest site for readers and book recommendations. Their mission is to help people find and share books they love.</p>

<p>My reading focus is <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/692620-gene-babon?utf8=%E2%9C%93&ref=nav_mybooks&shelf=read&sort=date_read&view=covers&title=gene-babon&per_page=100" target="_blank"><strong>business books</strong></a>, particularly in the areas of <strong>leadership</strong> and <strong>strategy</strong>. I perform an annual market analysis to identify the most recommended business books published in the preceeding calendar year. I publish this analysis to <strong>Beantown Web</strong>. I chose books to read largly from this annual market analysis. While I do not possess a Masters in Busiess Administration, I consider my ongong committment to business education to be my <strong>alt MBA</strong>. I have read and summarized more tha 150 business books.</p>
