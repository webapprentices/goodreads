This book sticks in my mind as one of the two best business books I read in 2007. (The other is Blue Ocean Strategy.)  Leadership requires effective communication.  If you have ever wondered why others don't appear to be as excited about your ideas as you are, then this book is for you.

The authors present a clear explanation for why "some ideas survive and others die."  The ideas that survive are <strong>Made to Stick</strong>.  If you have an idea that you are trying to communicate to coworkers, peers or family members, analyze your communication strategy against the authors' SUCCESs checklist.  Successful ideas conform to these six principles:

Simple > Unexpected > Concrete > Credentialed > Emotional > Story 

The most compelling example presented is the success of the Subway advertising campaign that featured Jared Fogle who lost more than 200 pounds by crafting a diet plan built around Subway's low-fat sub offerings.

Another popular example of an idea that galvanized a nation is John F. Kennedy's proclamation: "I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before the decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to earth."

If you want your ideas to resonate and energize a work group, then read this book to help ensure that your ideas are <strong>Made to Stick</strong>.
