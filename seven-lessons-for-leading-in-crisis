Crisis is the defining moment for a leader. Veteran business executive and educator, Bill George, presents a seven-step plan for leading in a crisis. This book is an easy read with a clear message.

Leaders of organizations facing crisis are given the opportunity to reinvent themselves, and their organizations, for the long haul. If you are a CEO-in-waiting, this book provides valuable guidance because "a smooth sea never made a skilled mariner."

Leadership is not about position, it's about moving in a direction. If you are an aspiring leader, focus on guiding others through a major problem; this is your best opportunity to develop leadership skills.

Here are the seven lessons to master:

1. Face reality, starting with yourself.
2. Don't be Atlas; get the world off your shoulders.
3. Dig deep for the root cause.
4. Get ready for the long haul.
5. Never waste a good crisis.
6. You're in the spotlight: Follow True North.
7. Go on the offense; focus on winning now.

Start with yourself, then help others. People seek out leaders. So do organizations. Bill George can help show you how to navigate during these tough times.
