In the SEAL program, it is all about the Team.  After all, there can be no leadership where there is no team.  Leadership requires belief in the mission and unyielding perseverance to achieve victory.

Analogies between going to war and going to work in the corporate world have been challenged for their relevance, and for good reason.  Nonetheless, the leadership challenges of igniting individuals in a team to perform in unison at a high level for the good of the organization remain real.  This book makes a valuable contribution to clarifying and resolving the challenges of leadership.

The core teaching here is that members of the team must ...

~ believe in the cause for which they are fighting.
~ believe in the plan they are asked to execute.
~ believe in and trust the leader they are asked to follow.

The cardinal rule of Extreme Ownership: <b><i>The leader must own everything in his or her world.</i></b>  There is no one else to blame.

When subordinates aren't doing what they should, leaders who exercise Extreme Ownership cannot blame the subordinates.  If an individual on the team is not performing at the level required for the team to succeed, the leader must train and mentor that underperformer.  In virtually every case, the SEAL troops and platoons that didn't perform well had leaders who blamed everyone and everything else.  Poor performance and mission failure were the result.

Nine concepts highlighted with examples throughout the book include ...

~ There are no bad teams, only bad leaders.
~ Second place is simply "the first loser."
~ Junior leaders must know that the boss will back them up.
~ Lack of coordination could well mean a death sentence.
~ Simplifying as much as possible is crucial to success.
~ Complex plans add to confusion, which can compound into disaster.
~ A leader who tries to take on too many problems simultaneously will likely fail at them all.
~ A broad and ambiguous mission results in lack of focus, ineffective execution and mission creep.
~ Leadership is the single greatest factor in any team's performance.
