<blockquote>Professional competence in not enough to be a good leader; good leaders must truly care about those entrusted to their care.</blockquote>Exceptional organizations, like the Marine Corps, all have cultures in which the leaders provide cover from above and the people on the ground look out for each other.  <strong>[book:Leaders Eat Last|16144853]</strong> offers a blueprint for structuring such an organization.  Author Simon Sinek does not disappoint in his sophomore effort.  See my five-star rating of his previous book, <strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/443959954" target="_blank">Start with Why</a>.</strong>

In an interesting approach that diverges from almost all books on leadership, Sinek explores the functioning of four chemicals in our body and how they control our behaviors.  The "selfish" chemicals—endorphins and dopamine—work to get us where we need to go as individuals.  The "selfless" chemicals—serotonin and oxytocin—incentivize us to work together and develop feelings of trust and loyalty.  These four chemicals—E.D.S.O.—combine to drive human behavior and shape corporate culture.

Additional concepts discussed include the following:

~ <strong>Circle of Safety</strong>—workers are better equipped to confront external dangers (market forces and competition) when they fear no danger from each other (internal politics, backstabbing and layoffs).

~ <strong>Destructive Abundance</strong>—when selfish pursuits are out of balance with selfless pursuits.

~ <strong>Eyeball Leadership</strong>—walking the halls and spending time with the employees you serve.
<blockquote>"No one wakes up in the morning to go to work with the hope that someone will manage us.  We wake up in the morning and go to work with the hope that someone will lead us." ~ Bob Chapman</blockquote>If you want to lead yourself, and inspire the people you serve in your organization, consider becoming a Leader who Eats Last.  Let us all be the leaders we wish we had.
