Women and men reached parity on college campuses in the United States in 1980. For the first time, just as many women graduated as men. In 1984, the year the Macintosh was launched, women in tech reached a high point, receiving nearly 40 percent of computer science degrees. Today, that percentage has been nearly cut in half. Why are women so underrepresented in technology fields? Emily Chang, long-time host of Bloomberg Technology explores.

During this journey we are introduced to the PayPal Mafia (an all boys club). We learn about prominent women in tech, such as Google's Susan Wojcicki, Marissa Mayer and Cheryl Sandberg. Other recognizable female business leaders include Ellen Pao at Kleiner Perkins and Katrina Lake at Stitch Fix.

Many lesser known female tech employees are interviewed. Source material includes the "Elephant in the Valley" survey of 250 accounts of unpublished, anonymous stories of women in tech. Examples of men behaving badly are not always a comfortable read. At times the reporting can extend beyond PG-13, like the encounters in Conference Room G and discussions around polyamory.

Silicon Valley companies have been largely created in the image of their mostly young, mostly male, mostly childless founders. Sure, you can bring your dog to work, but you are (mostly) on your own with your baby.

This analysis works best when it says focused on topics like the "motherhood penalty"â€”work is so rigged against mothers. Tech should be a really great job from women and families. You just need a computer and you don't always have to be in the office. Hopefully, as a society, we've learned lessons as a result of the pandemic and work life will improve for both women and men, alike.
