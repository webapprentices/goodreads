An "executive" is responsible for "execution."

If you are responsible for getting things done, and especially responsible for getting others to get things done, then <strong>The 4 Disciplines of Execution: Achieving Your Wildly Important Goals</strong> should be your roadmap.

Few business books I've read are as simple and complete as The Four Disciplines (4DX):

1. Focus on the Wildly Important
2. Act on the Lead Measures
3. Keep a Compelling Scoreboard
4. Create a Cadence of Accountability

A few choice morsels from one survey of workers at more than one hundred businesses and government agencies:

~ Only 15 percent of employees could name even one of the top three goals their leaders had identified.
~ Only 51 percent of employees could say that they were passionate about the team's goal.
~ Fully 87 percent of employees had no clear idea what they should be doing to achieve the goal.

Yikes!

If you work in a workplace that operates like this, then consider adopting the 4DX principles.  The first thing you should understand is that "the whirlwind" is the enemy of execution.  "The whirlwind" is a metaphor for the enormous amount of time and energy required to keep the organization at its current level of performance.  4DX is designed to operate in conjunction with "the whirlwind" and is an orderly pattern of conduct that leads to achievement of an organizational goal with excellence.

If you are a manager, and especially a senior leader in an organization, then <strong>The Four Disciplines of Execution</strong> is a reference material that should be read and referred to until all four disciplines are in place in your work group.
