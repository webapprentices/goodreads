This book provides structure to the strategy debate by presenting a framework to help determine which business strategies are most appropriate for different business environments.  The five strategy environments, and related strategies, are as follow:

~ Classical: Be big
~ Adaptive: Be fast
~ Visionary: Be first
~ Shaping: Be the orchestrator
~ Renewal: Be viable

Many people, myself included, grew up in a stable business environment of past decades that prompted a Classical approach to business strategy.  Globalization and the Internet have changed the business landscape significantly, prompting alternate business strategy models.  You might recognize these models through previous published works on strategy including the following:

~ Classical: Be big (<strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/790252840">Playing to Win</a></strong>)
~ Adaptive: Be fast (<strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/790136802">The End of Competitive Advantage</a></strong>)
~ Visionary: Be first (<strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/19663250">Blue Ocean Strategy</a></strong>)

The case studies presented throughout help clarify the different environments and approaches to strategy.  Get your strategy right and you increase your chance of winning.  The authors' research reveals that approximately half of all companies mismatch their approach to strategy to their environment in some way.  However, you still must execute.  There is no shortcut to the execution step.

<strong>Your Strategy Needs a Strategy: How to Choose and Execute the Right Approach</strong is suggested reading for all managers, and should be required reading for managers of the 50 percent of businesses that have mismatched their strategy to their environment.
