<p>Charles Koch is an MIT graduate who is worth in excess of $40 billion. Combining the wealth of his siblings, their spouses and offspring, the Koch family is the second richest family in America behind the Walton family. Yet, little is publicly known about this family. And what is shared in the media tends to be unflatering. <strong>Kochland</strong> is the story of Charles Koch and Koch Industries.</p>

<p>Charles Koch inherited a family business at age thity-two from his father who passed away suddenly in 1967. The business he was handed focused largely on the purchase and transportation of crude oil. To explore the life of Charles Koch is to reflect on the economy and politics of America in the late 20th and early 21st centuries.</p>

<p>Koch's approach to business centers around the philosophy he developed called Market-Based Management (MBM). This thought process leans conservative and decidedly libertarian. Government should simply get out the way of business enterprises and entrepreneurial efforts.</p>

<p>The epic Koch journey features battles with federal investigators and labor unions, responses to OPEC oil embargos and sibling lawsuits.</p>
