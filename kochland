<p>Charles Koch is an MIT graduate who is worth in excess of $40 billion. Combining the wealth of his siblings, their spouses and offspring, the Koch family is the second richest family in America behind the Walton family. Yet, little is publicly known about this family. And what is shared in the media tends to be unflattering. <strong>Kochland</strong> is the story of Charles Koch and Koch Industries.</p>

<p>Charles Koch inherited a family business at age thity-two from his father who passed away suddenly in 1967. The business he was handed focused largely on the purchase and transportation of crude oil. To explore the life of Charles Koch is to reflect on the economy and politics of America in the late 20th and early 21st centuries.</p>

<p>Koch's approach to business centers around the philosophy he developed called Market-Based Management (MBM). This thought process leans conservative and decidedly libertarian. Government should simply get out the way of business enterprises and entrepreneurial efforts.</p>

<p>The epic Koch Industries journey features battles with federal regulators and labor unions, as well as, responses to OPEC oil embargos and sibling lawsuits. Toss in forays into energy trading and financial engineering to add spice to the stew. However, the most power-forming activities included the development of political action committees and the implementation of corporate acquisition strategies. In particular, th reader learns about a failed acquistion of Purina Mills and a successful purchase of Georgia-Pacific. A key tenant of Market-Based Managment is learning from your mistakes.</p>

<p>If you dislike these topics, then you will not likely find <strong>Kochland</strong> to be an appealing read. However, since my career began in the oil industry, and since some of my biggest career successes were in Corporate America, I found this inside view of a mammoth, privately-held company to be intriguing, and surprisingly balanced.</p>

<p><strong>Kochland: The Secret History of Koch Industries and Corporate Power in America</strong> deserves its ranking as one of the four books on the Short List of <a href="https://beantownweb.blogspot.com/2020/06/best-business-books-2019.html" target="_blank"><strong>Best Business Books of 2019</strong></a>.</p>
