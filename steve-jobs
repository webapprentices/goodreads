An unvarnished look at one of the most heralded business leaders of the Personal Computer/Internet Age.  Volumes have been written about the impact that the late Steve Jobs has had on society.  This 600-page masterwork brings a life and a life's work into clear focus.

The trajectory of six industries were altered by his life force: personal computers, animated movies, music, phone, tablet computing and digital publishing.  Some called his world view a <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_distortion_field" target="_blank">reality distortion field</a>.</strong>  Steve called it "making a dent in the universe."

A book summary will not do this masterwork justice.  Read it.  Learn from it.  Think Different!
