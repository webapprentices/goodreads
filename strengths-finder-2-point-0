The value in this book gets created when you use the unique access code provided in every book and take the time to learn about yourself. The online evaluation will take about 30 minutes. The result is a profile of your Top Five Strengths (or Themes) -- I'm still not sure of the distinction. "What StrengthsFinder actually measures is talent, not strength." Despite the confusion, the result is valuable.

Gallop's research indicates that those who are allowed to do what they do best (focus on their strengths) are six times more likely to be engaged on their jobs and three times more likely to report having an excellent quality of life in general.

There are 34 themes/strengths/talents. Here are my five most dominant:

Learner | People who are especially talented in the Learner theme have a great desire to learn and want to continuously improve. In particular, the process of learning, rather than the outcome, excites them.

Strategic | People who are especially talented in the Strategic theme create alternative ways to proceed. Faced with any given scenario, they can quickly spot the relevant patterns and issues.

Analytical | People who are especially talented in the Analytical theme search for reasons and causes. They have the ability to think about all the factors that might affect a situation.

Focus | People who are especially talented in the Focus theme can take a direction, follow through, and make the corrections necessary to stay on track. They prioritize, then act.

Significance | People who are especially talented in the Significance theme want to be very important in the eyes of others. They are independent and want to be recognized.

Armed with this information, you can now understand why you enjoy certain activities over others which could come in handy during an interview, for example.

More importantly, if you are in a work group and each member of the team has completed the StrengthsFinder analysis, you can now look for opportunities to help each other play to their strengths. This should lead to a more productive, more engaged worker who is happier on the job and in life.

Go forth and test this theory.
