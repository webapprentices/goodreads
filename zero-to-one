<blockquote>"Unless they invest in the difficult task of creating new things, American companies will fail in the future no matter how big their profits remain today."</blockquote>Thus begins the quest to go from "Zero to One" which describes the process of creating something radically new and scaling it with intensive growth. The phrase is used in contrast to the term "1 to n" which means creating incremental improvements to what is already familiar.

This book offers no formula for success.  Instead, it is organized around seemingly random notes taken from a course about startups at Stanford University offered by one of the co-founders of PayPal turned venture fund investor.  Peter Thiel is the unofficial head of the PayPal Mafia.  Six members of this clan have gone on to become billionaires.  His advice should be listed to.

Among the thought experiments Thiel leads his readers through is "What important truth do very few people agree with you on?"

Among the principles he offers:

~ It is better to risk boldness than triviality.
~ A bad plan is better than no plan.
~ Competitive markets destroy profits.
~ Sales matter just as much as product.

His simple advice to start small and monopolize is precious.  Only by dominating a niche market can you expand into related and broader markets.  Amazon started with books.  Facebook started with Harvard students.  As you craft a plan to expand to adjacent markets, don't disrupt; avoid competition as much as possible.

One corollary is that individuals should strive to be great at something substantive -- to be a monopoly of one.
