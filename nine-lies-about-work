This book is NOT about The Big Lie, but rather about little lies—misconceptions, myths, misunderstandings—that are pervasive in modern work culture.

<strong>[book:Nine Lies About Work]</strong> attempts to answer the question: "If I am to help my team give their best, for as long as possible, which of these details are most critical?" Research supports the following eight precisely worded items (copyright ADP) that validly predict sustained team performance.

"Best of Me" Statements:

~ At work, I clearly understand what is expected of me.
~ I have the chance to use my strengths every day at work.
~ I know I will be recognized for excellent work.
~ In my work, I am always challenged to grow.

"Best of We" Statements:

~ I am really enthusiastic about the mission of my company.
~ In my team, I am surrounded by people who share my values.
~ My teammates have my back.
~ I have great confidence in my company's future.

What distinguishes the best team leaders from the rest is their ability to meet these two categories of needs for the people on their teams.

Research consistently validates that a majority of American workers are not fully engaged at work. At your next team meeting solicit feedback about these eight statements. There might well be a correlation between the responses you get and the level of engagement among team members. If you are a leader who wants to improve engagement (and retention) within your organization, start here.
