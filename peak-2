As individuals we underperform.  Here's why.

There is no such thing as predefined ability.  Training can create skills.  Individuals can improve -- and improve a lotâ€”with practice.  The right sort of practice, carried out over a sufficient period of time, leads to improvement.  Nothing else delivers this desired outcome.

The author introduces us to different types of practice, such as naive practice, purposeful practice and deliberate practice.  The author provides examples of each and cites research supporting the efficacy of these approaches.  My personal favorite example is the golfer who has been playing for 30 years and still can't break 100.  This example of naive practice reveals that repetition alone will not improve performance. 

Purposeful practice requires getting out of one's comfort zone.  Deliberate practice extends purposeful practice and requires a coach, feedback and course correction.  Deliberate practice is purposeful practice that knows where it is going and how to get there.

Deliberate practice remains the gold standard for anyone in any field who wishes to take advantage of the gift of adaptability in order to build new skills and abilities.  Deliberate practice can be used by anyone who wants to improve at anything, even just a little bit.

Throughout this exploration of Peak performance we learn about people who exhibit "extraordinary" talents such as memorizing strings of digits, navigating the unwieldy streets of London, playing chess while blindfolded, and other experts in their fields such as surgeons, rock climbers and Top Gun pilots.

<strong>Peak: Secrets from the New Science of Expertise</strong> also presents real-world implications for business leaders.  Training should focus on doing rather than knowing.  Increased use of simulators (flight training and surgical procedures) can help develop Peak performers.

The focus should be on purposeful practice rather than mindless repetition.  And as AI takes over mindlessly repetitive tasks, the demand for Peak performers and Peak performance training will likely increase.  Remember: if your mind is wandering or you're relaxed and just having fun, you probably won't improve.

The only challenge I encountered was understanding the concept of a "mental representation" which is key to mastering any skill.  <blockquote>"A mental representation is a mental structure that corresponds to an object, an idea, a collection of information, or anything else, concrete or abstract, that the brain is thinking about."</blockquote>  I'll leave this somewhat cryptic explanation to the experts.  For now, I just need to get out of my comfort zone and begin the journey of applying the fundamentals of deliberate practice to the life skills I want to master.
