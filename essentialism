Say "Yes!" to Essentialism.

Essentialism is the disciplined pursuit of less.  It is the antidote to majoring in minor activities.  The basic value proposition of Essentialism is as follows:
<blockquote>Only once you give yourself permission to stop trying to do it all, to stop saying yes to everyone, can you make your highest contribution towards the things that really matter.</blockquote>Very few things in life are Essential.  Almost everything else is noise.  This book helps you distinguish the vital few from the trivial many and guides the reader to remove obstacles so that essential things have clear, smooth passage.

The author provides a compelling case for following the path of Essentialism by periodically comparing and contrasting Nonessentialists ("Takes on too much and work suffers") and Essentialists ("Chooses carefully in order to do great work").  The author believes that virtually everyone alive today is infected with Nonessentialism.  "It is embedded in job descriptions that provide huge lists of required skills and experience as standard."  I find it difficult to mount a counter argument.

Essentialism is an easy read with 20 short (Essentialist) chapter titles such as Uncommit, Subtract, Focus, etc.  A bonus chapter delivers Leadership Essentials.  If you are in a leadership role and you are not practicing Essentialism, you may not only be undermining your efforts, but infecting peers and subordinates with your Nonessentialist practices and behaviors.  

Essentialism deserves its ranking as one of <a href="http://beantownweb.blogspot.com/2015/01/best-business-books-2014.html">The Best Business Books of 2014</a>.  This book expands on the five-star efforts of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/629707592">The ONE Thing</a> and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/83990739">Getting Things Done</a> and should be required reading for anyone, especially managers,  who feel overworked and underutilized.
