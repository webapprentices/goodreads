This book explores how technology is disrupting the future. In particular, exponentially accelerating technology, which is any technology that doubles in power while dropping in price on a regular basis. Whenever a new technology offers a tenfold increase in value -- cheaper, faster and better -- there's little that can slow it down.

A new invention that creates a new market is referred to as a "disruptive innovation." A paradigm-shifting technology example would be silicon chips replacing vacuum tubes. From a business perspective the application of disruptive technology leads to a business disruption like the one witnessed when Netflix replaced Blockbuster.
