This book explores how technology is disrupting the future. In particular, exponentially accelerating technology, which is any technology that doubles in power while dropping in price on a regular basis. Whenever a new technology offers a tenfold increase in value -- cheaper, faster and better -- there's little that can slow it down.

A new invention that creates a new market is referred to as a "disruptive innovation." A paradigm-shifting technology example would be silicon chips replacing vacuum tubes. From a business perspective the application of disruptive technology leads to a business disruption like the one witnessed when Netflix replaced Blockbuster.

Exponential technology topics discussed include the following: quantum computing, machine learning, artificial intelligence, Internet of Things, LIDAR, robotics, virtual and augmented reality, 3-D printing, digital currencies, blockchain, nanotechnology, CRISPR,  

The reason The Future is Faster Than You Think is that these technology breakthroughs are converging and accelerating the pace of innovation. The practical implication of this acceleration is that jobs will be created for some and jobs will disappear for many.

The authors invest the majority of the chapters exploring the future of industry segments including the following: shopping, advertising, entertainment, education, healthcare, longevity, finance and food. 

A perspective to contemplate: a mere century ago (plus), the richest people on Planet Earth did not have air-conditioning, running water, indoor plumbing, automobiles, refrigerators, telephones or computers. What conveniences will our children's children access in the near future that we only contemplate today in the form of science fiction?
