This book explores how technology is disrupting the future. Not just any technology, but rather, exponentially accelerating technology, which is any technology that doubles in power while dropping in price on a regular basis.

A new invention that creates a new market is referred to as a "disruptive innovation." A paradigm-shifting technology example would be silicon chips replacing vacuum tubes. From a business perspective the application of disruptive technology leads to a business disruption like the one witnessed when Netflix replaced Blockbuster.
