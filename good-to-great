I picked up this classic at a used book store and reread it 15 years after its publication.  

Detractors contend that some of the Good to Great companies used in this comparative analysis have not held up over time.  And that is exactly the point.  Follow the principles outlined in this analysis and you place your company in position to succeed.  Stop following the principles and you cease being Great, or even Good.

So, what are these principles?  Here are two compelling ones:

~ <strong>The Hedgehog Concept:</strong> If you cannot be the best in the world at your core business, then your core business absolutely cannot form the basis of a great company.

~ <strong>The Flywheel and the Doom Loop:</strong> The process of relentlessly pushing a giant heavy flywheel in one direction, turn upon turn, building momentum until a point of breakthrough, and beyond.

Along the way we learn about Level 5 leaders (quiet, humble, modest, reserved, shy and gracious).  We also learn about getting the right people on the bus, the wrong people off the bus and the right people in the right seats before deciding where to drive the bus.  And, we must employ the Stockdale Paradox (retain faith that you will prevail in the end, as well as, confront the most brutal facts of your current reality).

Organization leaders would be well-served to learn why "good is the enemy of great" and employ the principles outlined in this landmark comparison of companies that overcame goodness to attain greatness.

<b>Side Note:</b> I spent nine years as a manager within Warner-Lambert Company, one of the good companies that was unsuccessful at making the leap to great.  I found the external analysis presented in this book particularly insightful.
