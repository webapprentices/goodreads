This handbook is designed to make sense of the senseless. In this seminal document, published in 1995, we are introduced to a different way of being smart—by having "emotional intelligence." 

People who possess emotional intelligence typically excel in real life. The qualities of an emotionally intelligent person include the following:

~ self-awareness
~ impulse control
~ persistence
~ zeal and self-motivation
~ empathy
~ social deftness

Emotional Intelligence (EQ) is not fixed at birth. However, childhood and adolescence are critical windows of opportunity for setting down the essential emotional habits that will govern our lives.

All emotions are, in essence, impulses to act, the instantaneous plans for handling life that evolution has instilled in us. In a very real sense we have two minds—a rational mind and an emotional mind—one that thinks and one that feels. Most of the time these two minds are exquisitely coordinated. However, when passions surge, the balance tips, and the emotional mind captures the upper hand. Emotional explosions are, essentially, neural hijackings.

There is a lot to digest and contemplate here. This is not exactly a "one and done" book. The practical examples offered to overcome neural hijackings require practice. The keys are to understand when a hijack occurs—in yourself and in others—and to have a plan in place to self-correct a behavior that may be detrimental to well-being.

The art of relationships is, in large part, skill in managing emotions in others. To that end, the more we know about the process of emotional development, the better we can understand our own emotions and the origin of emotions in others. This book lays important groundwork in developing that understanding. The emotional journey we have all been on now has a road map.
