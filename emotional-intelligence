This book is a guide to making sense of the senseless. The focus is on a different way of being smart -- by having "emotional intelligence." 

People who possess emotional intelligence typically excel in real life. The qualities of an emotionally intelligent person include the following:

~ self-awareness
~ Impulse control
~ persistence
~ zeal and self-motivation
~empathy
~social deftness

Emotional intelligence is not fixed at birth. However, childhood and adolescence are critical windows of opportunity for setting down the essential emotional habits that will govern our lives.
