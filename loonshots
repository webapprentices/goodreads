<blockquote><strong>Loonshot</strong>: A neglected project, widely dismissed, its champion written off as unhinged.</blockquote>

<p>A <strong>loonshot</strong> differs from a <strong>moonshot</strong> which is an ambitious and expensive goal, widely expected to have great significance.</p>

<p>Most loonshots never get a chance. They pass through long dark tunnels of skepticism and uncertainty, crushed or neglected. This book offers insights into why good teams, with the best intentions and excellent people, kill great ideas. For example, by the early 2000s, Nokia was selling half the smartphones on the planet. Today, their market share in Europe alone is less than 2 percent. Why?</p>

<p>To explore this question, the author first walks us through several examples of loonshots:
~ the invention of radar and its impact on World War II
~ the development of the transistor and its impact on technology advances
~ the discovery of statins to treat elevated levels of blood cholesterol
</p>

<p>Along the way we learn that there are two different <i>types</i> of loonshots--product loonshots (P-type) and strategy loonshots (S-type). A comparison between the demise of Pan Am and the success of American Airlines illustrates the differences.</p>

<p>One scientific principle to understand is a <b><i>phase transition.</i></b> Think of water as it transitions to ice at 32 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>

<p>Another concept is "artists" vs. "soldiers." Some individuals (artists) within an organization are responsible for developing high-risk, early-stage ideas. The vast majority of workers (soldiers) are responsible for the already-successful, steady -growth part of an organization.</p>

<p>Artists should report to a <b><i>loonshot nursery,</i></b> a sheltered environment where high-risk projects can grow and flourish. The vast majority of others report to the <b><i>franchise group</i></b> to help maintain the status quo and apply incremental improvements to existing products and services.</p>

<p>Both artists and soldiers have to feel equally loved. Both water and ice must be equally appreciated for their unique contributions.</p>
