<blockquote><strong>Loonshot</strong>: A neglected project, widely dismissed, its champion written off as unhinged.</blockquote>

<p>A <strong>loonshot</strong> differs from a <strong>moonshot</strong> which is an ambitious and expensive goal, widely expected to have great significance.</p>

<p>Most loonshots never get a chance. They pass through long dark tunnels of skepticism and uncertainty, crushed or neglected. This book offers insights into why good teams, with the best intentions and excellent people, kill great ideas. For example, by the early 2000s, Nokia was selling half the smartphones on the planet. Today, their market share in Europe is less than 2 percent. Why?</p>
