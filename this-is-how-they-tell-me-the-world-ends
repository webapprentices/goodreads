<blockquote><em>"The most likely way for the world to be destroyed, most experts agree, is by accident. This will not end well."</em></blockquote>

<strong><em>This Is How They Tell Me the World Ends</em></strong> is a book of cyber espionage revelations. A few of the central figures include the NSA (National Security Agency), <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/06/04/1176747650/a-decade-on-edward-snowden-remains-in-russia-though-u-s-laws-have-changed" target="_blank">Edward Snowden</a> (an American-born former NSA contractor, now a citizen of Russia), and various entities of the foreign governments that oppose the United States.

The current era of cyber espionage began around 2009 when the United States and Israel attacked Iran. Not with conventional weapons, but with cyber weapons. The attack became known as Stuxnet and was successful in exploiting a bug in the Microsoft Windows operating system and causing substantial damage to Iran's effort to develop nuclear weapons capability.

Along the way we learn about lesser-known cyber espionage exploits, including the following:

The GUNMAN Project
Operation Shotgiant
Heartbleed
ExternalBlue
WannaCry
Project Lakhta
NotPetya
Nitro Zeus

These exploits typically involve zero-day (pronounced "oh-day") software bugs that can be used to hack into machines. Once detected, creators of the buggy software have zero days to patch the code due to the seriousness of potential damage. There are financial incentives for governments and bad actors to withhold these bugs from the software creators. This, in turn, creates a black market that fuels cyber espionage.

<blockquote><em>"We're entering a world where every thermostat, every electrical heater, every air conditioner, every power plant, every medical device, every hospital, every traffic light, every automobile will be connected to the internet. Think about what it will mean for the world when those devices are the subject of attack."</em></blockquote>

This Is How They Tell Me the World Ends deserves its ranking as one of the Best Business Books of 2021.
