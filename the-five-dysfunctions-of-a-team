The Five Dysfunctions of a Team is a leadership fable about a fictitious 150-employee technology company in Silicon Valley. A new CEO is brought in to provide direction to the underperforming company.

An off-site meeting is held with the management team. The CEO determines why the company is being beaten by its competition despite having more money, better technology, and more talented and experienced executives: the team is dysfunctional!

The CEO reveals Dysfunction #1...

~ Absence of Trust

A team building exercise follows. Teammates feel better. Four more dysfunctions are revealed...

~ Fear of Conflict
~ Lack of Commitment
~ Avoidance of Accountability
~ Inattention to Results

The team gets back to work. Personal conversations follow. Some members of the team move on. The team reassembles for a follow-up off-site meeting. Improvements are noted.

Conclusion: teambuilding is a process that requires time and effort. Most importantly teamwork requires leadership!

The Five Dysfunctions of a Team was published in 2002 and remains on the Wall Street Journal Hardcover Business Best Seller list. I first read this book a few years ago and decided to give it a second try.

Readers will recognize the characters in the fable. However, precious little substance is offered to remedy the five disfuncions. The final 25% of the book offers an explanation of The Model behind the five dysfuncions.

Readers who are looking for a more rigorous exploration of workplace dysfunction should consider the following related five-star offerings:
