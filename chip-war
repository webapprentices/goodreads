<blockquote><strong>"Most of the world's GDP is produced with devices that rely on semiconductors. For a product that didn't exist seventy-five years ago, this is an extraordinary ascent."<strong></blockquote>The beauty of this epic tale is the simplicity of the writing. One might think that at 54 chapters, <strong>Chip War</strong> might rival the 1,400+ pages of <strong>[book:War and Peace|656].</strong> However, each chapter here is bite-size and tells a complete story.

The journey begins during the battles of World War II. The outcome was determined by industrial output—tanks, ships, planes, artillery—and the United States reigned supreme. After the War industrial output shifted focus to houses and automobiles. Enter William Shockley, John Bardeen and Walter Brattain. Their creation of a transistor while at Bell Labs marked a turning point and began a decades-long journey to digitize the industrial economy.

The remaining journey is told through the stories of 13 main characters who played critical roles in the development and deployment of semiconductors. Of particular note is how Taiwan emerged as the de facto chokehold on manufacturing of the most advanced semiconductors and why this threatens global security.
