So simple, yet so effective. I uncovered this 1985 classic at a book sale and had to own it and reread it.

A follow-up to The One Minute Manager (goals, praisings and reprimands), this booklet guides new supervisors and seasoned managers through the process of managing for performance. It is time to role up your sleeves and help your team win.

Your leadership style is how you behave, over time, when you are trying to influence the performance of others. Many untrained managers have one style (delegator? micromanager?). Effective managers have four styles, depending on the situation. This fluid managerial approach is referred to as situational leadership.

Each worker has a development level (D1 through D4) depending on the task they are asked to perform. A seasoned manager (situational leader) can diagnose the development level, in cooperation with the worker, and apply the appropriate leadership style (high or low support, high or low direction) as outlined in a four square matrix.

While simple, this approach requires daily practice and three managerial skills: flexibility, diagnosis and partnering.

Leadership and the One Minute Manager: Increasing Effectiveness Through Situational Leadership is a handy tool for any manager who is tasked with optimizing the performance of a team of workers.
