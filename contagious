This book offers a framework for helping content creators make their content "contagious" or likely to spread or diffuse from person to person via word of mouth and social influence.

Why is developing "contagious" content important?  Because word of mouth is the primary factor behind 20 percent to 50 percent of all purchasing decisions.  The more "contagious" your content, the more likely others will share it with friends and spread your message via word of mouth.

Here are the Six Principles of Contagiousness (The Six STEPPS):

~ Social Currency
~ Triggers
~ Emotion
~ Public
~ Practical Value
~ Stories

To help explain these principles, the author explores these talked-about slogans ...

~ "Break me off a piece of that Kit Kat bar."

... and products ...

~ the $100 cheesesteak
~ black toilet paper

... and YouTube videos ...
