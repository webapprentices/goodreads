"Good ideas with great execution are how you make magic."

Thus begins the introduction of a process for lifting the veil that blinds many organizations and prevents magic from happening. This book matters. 

The secret sauce of making magic is OKRs -- Objectives and Key Results. While many organizations claim to manage process using a variation on these activities, few do it well. Few companies execute at a level they could. If you currently toil in one of those organizations, shine a light on your Objectives and Key Results.

An <b>Objective</b> is simply <b>WHAT</b> is to be achieved, no more and no less.

<b>Key Results</b> benchmark and monitor <b>HOW</b> we get to the objective. 

It's not a key result unless it has a number. "As measured by" provides that number. A target date provides the time frame for completing each key result.

"We will achieve a certain OBJECTIVE as measured by the following KEY RESULTS ..."

Yeah, you might say, "I know all that stuff already." But, do you? Do you practice it? Do you practice it, daily? Can you recite your OKRs, right now? Can you quickly access the OKRs of your coworkers? Is your organization transparent enough to enable such sharing of information. How can you work effectively with coworkers across workgroups when you are unaware of their OKRs?

OKRs are Swiss Army knives, suited to any environment. OKRs are the scaffolding for hitting home runs.

The four OKR "superpowers" are focus, align, track and stretch. Separate chapters are devoted to each superpower. In addition, OKRs' younger sibling, CFRs (Conversation, Feedback and Recognition), are introduced to help enable workers to activate these superpowers.

As a frame of reference, the author provides a history lesson on the evolution of OKRs, starting with Peter Drucker and his work in the 1950s on "management by objectives" with [book:The Practice of Management|48018]. Andy Grove at Intel continued the evolution with [book:High Output Management|324750]. Author John Doerr, venture capitalist, and others, brought these teachings to Google.
