<blockquote>"Much like iron is forged by heat, your most significant challenges and your most painful experiences present the greatest opportunities for your personal growth."</blockquote>Discovering your True North is hard work.  This book does not contain six easy steps to discover your True North or other simple formulas.  Instead, it contains profiles of leaders, mostly in the business world, and their struggles to learn and practice leadership principles that are universally acceptable, yet unique to the individual.

Your journey toward authentic leadership, and discovering your True North, typically passes through three phases: 

1. Preparing for Leadership, when people act as individual contributors and character forms.
2. Leading, which begins the rapid accumulation of leadership experiences.
3. Generativity, which involves forgoing retirement to share leadership knowledge and wisdom with multiple organizations.

Many leaders have been shaped by severe trials in their lives.  These events, called crucibles, can be used to shape leadership style and identify True North.  Think back on the crucibles of your life and you may uncover your motivation for making a positive change and desire to make a difference in society.

The greatest challenge in the journey to find True North occurs when you transform from <i>I</i> to <i>We</i> and become a servant leader.  The stories of dozens of business leaders help to illuminate the key concepts presented about how others became servant leaders.

Of course, if you have no interest in leading others, then this book won't add much value.  If however, you are struggling to advance your career or identify your true calling, then the journey to <strong>[book:Discover Your True North|25957932]</strong> is an adventure worth taking.
