"Leadership is communicating to people their worth and potential so clearly that they are inspired to see it in themselves." ~ Stephen R. Covey
The author, a former nuclear-powered submarine captain, explains the evolution of his leader-leader model, a structure better suited for intellectual work. This structure runs counter to the traditional leader-follower model which is the command-and-control structure that is optimized for physical labor such as building the pyramids or working in factories.

A central theme here is that people who are treated as followers treat others as followers when it is their turn to lead. A vast untapped human potential is lost as a result of treating people as followers.

The journey begins when the leader retains accountability and releases control of the actual decisions to the department heads. Each layer of management would, in turn, learn to do the same. One mechanism for making this happen is to encourage those in your command to communicate using phrases like "I intent to ... ". This communication style runs contrary to old-school, command-and-control responses such as "I do whatever I'm told to do."

A few nuggets gleamed from the author's writing include the following:

~ Focusing on avoiding mistakes takes our focus away from becoming truly exceptional.

~ Don't move information to authority, move authority to the information.

~ Organizational clarity: You tackle it by being honest about what you intend to achieve and communicating that all the time, at every level.

~ A little rudder far from the rocks is a lot better than a lot of rudder close to the rocks.

The core of the leader-leader model is giving employees control over what they work on and how they work. What would make this book even more effective would be to see the implementation of this model in the private sector, not just in a military setting. Perhaps there is a sequel in the works.

In lieu of a sequel, check out my five-star review of It's Your Ship .
