Wow.  Insightful.  This book is a gem.  I've come across this 2008 book on several "<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/top-5-must-reads-effective-ceos-2019-5" target="_blank">best of</a>" lists and finally got around to reading it.

At the core resides the concept of a tribe which is a number of people between 20 and 150.   A small company might be a tribe; whereas, a large company will consist of many tribesâ€”a tribe of tribes.

What makes some tribes more effective than others is culture.  The words that tribe members use on a daily basis describe this culture.

Here is a brilliantly simple test:  Listen and observe a tribe in its elements (typically at work, but could be elsewhere).  The predominant talk among tribal members will reveal the tribal stage as follows:

Stage 1: "Life sucks."
Stage 2: "My life sucks."
Stage 3: "I'm great ... (and you're not)."
Stage 4: "We're great ... (and they're not)."
Stage 5: "Life is great."

The higher the stage number, the better the team dynamic and the more positive and productive the culture.  Some anthropologists believe that human society started at Stage 1.

Most workplaces are either Stage 2 (25 percent) or Stage 3 (49 percent) cultures.  You can recognize a Stage 2 culture as soon as you walk in the door.  Fair or not, think Department of Motor Vehicles.  Many professionals aspire to work in a Stage 4 (22 percent) culture.  However, many of those same professionals tend to overestimate their own tribal talk by two stages!

As a leader you're role is to monitor and influence the conversation among tribe members, helping individuals to progress one level.  If you are successful, you will be recognized as tribal leader.  This book provides guidance on how to monitor and influence tribal conversation.

If you are in a management role and are responsible for influencing behavior and team dynamics, then <strong>[book:Tribal Leadership: Leveraging Natural Groups to Build a Thriving Organization|2741559]</strong> should be on your short list of reading material.
