It's 2046. How did we get here?

You only need to look at recent trends to project what is likely to unfold over the next few years. The author takes this approach to peer into the future. However, he is careful to point out that his analysis is more about trajectories than destinies.

At the center of every significant change in our lives today is a technology of some sort. Technology is humanity's accelerant.

This book paves a road to the future using well-documented trends in technology. Since technologies constantly evolve and change, we are all Endless Newbies regardless of our age and experience. Embrace being an Endless Newbie.

These trajectories are organized into 12 chapters with titles such as Becoming, Cognifying, Flowing, Screening, etc. which represent various slices of these technology trajectories. For example, in Cognifying, the author posits that everything we formerly electrified we will now cognify (add intelligence). "The business plans of the next 10,000 startups are easy to forecast: The X and add AI."

Robots are inevitable and job replacement is only a matter of time. As a result of these technology trajectories we will be forced to surrender to machines and spend decades in a permanent identity crisis, continually asking ourselves what humans are good for. Our human assignment will be to keep making jobs for robots, and that is a task that will never be finished.

This is not a race against the machines, but rather, a race with the machines. The race will not end positively, on a personal level, unless you embrace the trajectory of technology and carve out a personal path that adds value to humanity with the assistance of automation.

The Inevitable: Understanding the 12 Technological Forces That Will Shape Our Future is on the Must Read shelf of The Best Business Books of 2016.
