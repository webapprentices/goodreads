The five elements that determine the health of any organization are as follows: leadership, teamwork, culture, strategy and meetings. People who work in unhealthy organizations eventually come to view work as drudgery which leads to diminished sense of hope and lower self-esteem.

According to the author there are four required disciplines that leaders of organizations must focus on in order to develop a healthy organization:

~ Build a cohesive leadership team
~ Create clarity
~ Overcommunicate clarity
~ Reinforce clarity

This cookbook approach offers a recipe for designing a healthy organization. For example, in order to Create Clarity (Discipline 2) the leadership team has to answer six critical questions. The Checklist for Organizational Health at the close of the book provides a concise cheat sheet for improving the health of any organization.

Most creative idea: Create a one-page Playbook that leadership team members keep with them at all times.

Most insightful distinction: There are four types of meetings. Use them appropriately.

Best definition:
An organization's strategy is nothing more than the collection of intentional decisions a company makes to give itself the best chance to thrive and differentiate from competitors.
If you are in a leadership position in an organization of any size or type, The Advantage: Why Organizational Health Trumps Everything Else in Business can provide you with guidance necessary to help your organization succeed.
