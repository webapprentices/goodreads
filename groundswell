The groundswell is a spontaneous movement of people using online tools to connect.  <strong>Groundswell</strong> was one of the first, and best documented, books chronicling the social media phenomenon.

Since the book was published in 2008, it would be easy to dismiss this research-oriented guidebook as dated.  After all, a technology called Twitter is relegated to single page.  The authors conclude as follows: "Twitter is likely to find its place among other groundswell technologies, and companies should pay attention to it."

The focus of <strong>Groundswell</strong> is measurable business success.  The guiding principle is to concentrate on the relationships, not the technologies.  In so doing, the authors advise business leaders to master groundswell thinking because the technologies are ever shifting and ever growing.

POST is the foundation of groundswell thinking.  The POST method is a four-step planning process used to build a groundswell strategy.  POST involves people, objectives, strategy and technology.

The five objectives that companies can pursue in the groundswell are as follows:

~ listening
~ talking
~ energizing
~ supporting
~ enhancing

Using this framework the authors proceed to document several successful case studies that target each objective.

The authors conclude that "companies that aren't wired into the groundswell in 2012 will look very twentieth centuryâ€”which is to say, out of touch."

Additional books to consider on the topic of social media include the following:
