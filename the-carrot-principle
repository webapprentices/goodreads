Nearly four out of five employees who quit their jobs cite a lack of recognition as a key reason for leaving.  If you are a business leader, or aspire to become one, this book offers practical guidance on how to effectively lead your workforce.

Here are the two things your workers want most:

~ career/learning development opportunities
~ recognition

Failing to acknowledge and support your workers leads to low morale and turnover.  In a competitive business environment this leads to an underperforming business.

<strong>The Carrot Principle</strong> details the Basic Four areas of business leadership:

~ goal setting
~ communication
~ trust
~ accountability

Great management is born when recognition is added to these four fundamentals of leadership.

If you are looking for an action plan to energize the team you lead, this book is a keeper and should be referred to daily.<blockquote>"When I make a mistake I'm recognized 100 percent of the time; when I do something great, I'm not recognized 99 percent of the time."</blockquote>If this statement describes the culture where you work, then start reading <strong>The Carrot Principle</strong> and start making a positive difference in your cultureâ€”or become one of the employees who quits their jobs citing a lack of recognition as a key reason for leaving.
