<strong>[book:Lean In|16071764]</strong> receives five stars for the importance of its message:
<blockquote>A truly equal world would be one where women ran half our countries and companies and men ran half our homes.</blockquote>This book informs and educates:

~ Imposter Syndrome—the phenomenon of capable people being plagued by self-doubt.

~ Tiara Syndrome—women who expect that if they keep doing their job well someone will notice and place a tiara on their head.

~ Currently, fathers make up less than four percent of parents who work full-time inside the home.

This book is more autobiographical and funnier than I thought it would be:

~ To the best of our knowledge Sheryl never actually <i>played</i> as a child, but really just organized other children's play.

~ Careers are a jungle gym, not a ladder.  On a ladder, most climbers are stuck staring at the butt of the person above.

~ I carry a little notebook ... <i>an actual notebook</i> that I write in with <i>an actual pen</i>.  In the tech world, this is like carrying a stone tablet and chisel.

~ People were asked to fill in their hobbies.  Half of the men in the group listed "their children" as hobbies.  <i>A hobby?</i>  For most mothers, kids are not a hobby.  Showering is a hobby.

This book—by a woman, about women—should be read by all men, not just men in leadership positions.  This book makes the case for <strong>leaning in</strong>, for being ambitious in any pursuit.
<blockquote>Leadership is about making others better as a result of your presence and making sure that impact lasts in your absence.</blockquote><strong>[book:Lean In|16071764]</strong> deserves its <strong>Top Shelf</strong> status as one of the <strong><a href="http://beantownweb.blogspot.com/2013/12/best-business-books-2013.html" target="_blank">Best Business Books of 2013</a>.</strong>
