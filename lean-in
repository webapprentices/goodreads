Lean In receives five stars for the importance of its message:
A truly equal world would be one where women ran half our countries and companies and men ran half our homes.
This book informs and educates:

~ Imposter Syndrome -- the phenomenon of capable people being plagued by self-doubt.

~ Tiara Syndrome -- women who expect that if they keep doing their job well someone will notice and place a tiara on their head.

~ Currently, fathers make up less than four percent of parents who work full-time inside the home.

This book is more autobiographical and funnier than I thought it would be:

~ To the best of our knowledge Sheryl never actually played as a child, but really just organized other children's play.

~ Careers are a jungle gym, not a ladder. On a ladder, most climbers are stuck staring at the butt of the person above.

~ I carry a little notebook ... an actual notebook that I write in with an actual pen. In the tech world, this is like carrying a stone tablet and chisel.

~ People were asked to fill in their hobbies. Half of the men in the group listed "their children" as hobbies. A hobby? For most mothers, kids are not a hobby. Showering is a hobby.

This book -- by a woman, about women -- should be read by all men, not just men in leadership positions. This book makes the case for leaning in, for being ambitious in any pursuit.
Leadership is about making others better as a result of your presence and making sure that impact lasts in your absence.
Lean In deserves its Top Shelf status as one of the Best Business Books of 2013.
