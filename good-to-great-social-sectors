This is the first of two monographs—long articles or short books on a particular subject—published to support Jim Collins' business classic <strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1709484164" target="_blank">Good to Great</a>.</strong> The other monograph was <strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2918727125" target="_blank">Turning the Flywheel</a>.</strong>

This "book" is an easy read. According to Jim Collins, "I originally intended this text to be a new chapter in future editions of <strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1709484164" target="_blank">Good to Great</a>.</strong>

Collins sets the table by stating, "In my work with nonprofits, I find that they're in desperate need of greater discipline—disciplined planning, disciplined people, disciplined governance, disciplined allocation of resources. A culture of discipline is not a principle of business, it is a principle of greatness."
