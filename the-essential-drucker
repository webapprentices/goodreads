Reading The Essential Drucker is like listening to a boxed set from your favorite recording artist in vinyl format. The music is timeless and so is the business advice of Peter Drucker.

Here are a hand-selected dozen of The Greatest Hits you will experience during this journey through six decades of mastering the art and science of management:
There is only one valid definition of business purpose: to create a customer.
Because its purpose it to create a customer, the business enterprise has two -- and only these two -- basic functions: marketing and innovation.
Results exist only on the outside. The result of a business is a satisfied customer.
Customers pay only for what is of use to them and gives them value. Nothing else constitutes "quality."
The aim of marketing is to know and understand the customer so well that the product or service fits him and sells itself.
Being at least as good as the [industry] leader is a prerequisite for being competitive.
The [business] leader's first task is to be the trumpet that sounds a clear sound.
There is no correlation (unless it be a negative one) between performance as a bench engineer and performance as a manager.
Not to innovate is the single largest reason for the decline of existing organizations. Not to know how to manage is the single largest reason for the failure of new ventures.
An innovation, to be effective, has to be simple and it has to be focused. It should do only one thing; otherwise, it confuses. If it is not simple, it will not work.
Not enough people have at least one first-rate skill or knowledge area.
Waste as little effort as possible on improving areas of low competence.
Ask your leadership team how familiar they are with the business teachings of Peter Drucker. Receiving a response like "Who is Peter Drucker?" is like hearing "Who were The Beatles?"
