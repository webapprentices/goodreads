The Industrial Revolution ushered in humanity's First Machine Age. Computers and other digital advances have ushered in the Second Machine Age. Digital technologies have done for mental power what the steam engine and its descendants did for muscle power.

The two MIT authors present research that has led to three broad conclusions:

~ We are living in a time of astonishing progress with digital technologies.
~ The transformations brought about by digital technology will be profoundly beneficial ones.
~ Digitization is going to bring with it some thorny challenges.

In addition, three characteristics of the Second Machine Age center around technology innovation being exponential, digital and combinatorial.

Technological advances will appear with increasing speed because of these three characteristics. This will create disruption, especially for those who are unprepared. Both bounty (the size of the economic pie) and spread (the distance between the haves and the have nots) are likely to increase as the Second Machine Age progresses.

The net effect is to decrease demand for less skills labor and increase demand for skilled labor. The warning here is that technological progress is going to leave behind some people, perhaps even a lot of people, as it races ahead.

Most disturbing thought:
"The role of humans as the most important factor of production is bound to diminish in the same way that the role of horses in agricultural production was first diminished and then eliminated by the introduction of tractors."
