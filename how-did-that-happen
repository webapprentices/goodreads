Accountable people get results. Accountable cultures produce results. If you work for a living, and other people are involved in the process, then this book is a must read, both for you and for others in your organziation.

"How Did That Happen?" shows you how to hold others accountable for delivering on expectations in a positive, principled way that delivers results. The authors present a systematic framework for establishing expectations (The Outer Ring) and dealing with unmet expectations (The Inner Ring).

The Outer Ring: to hold someone accountable means to effectively perform four actions -- form, communicate, align and inspect -- that contribute to the fulfillment of an expectation.

The journey to completing The Outer Ring includes helpful checklists and self-assessments including:

~ The Five Connection Questions
~ Seven Clues for Detecting a Negative Connection
~ The Top Five Reasons People Don't Hold Others Accountable
~ The Seven Most Common Mistakes People Make When Communicating Expectations

The Inner Ring: to determine why expectations are falling short requires "accountability conversations" that help you assess the need for one of four solutions -- motivation, training, accountability and culture.

The journey to completing The Inner Ring includes helpful checklists and self-assessments including:

~ Six Conversation Killers
~ Seven Telltale Measures of Motivation
~ Four Techniques for Enrolling Others in the "Cause"
~ The Five D's Fast Training Model
~ The Five Common Accountability Cultures

The Bottom Line on "How Did That Happen?": skillfully managing unmet expectations is a characteristic of any organization that enjoys or aspires to greatness.

How Did That Happen is my second candidate for Best Business Book of 2010. The first is Getting Things Done published in 2001.
