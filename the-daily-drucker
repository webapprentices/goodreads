Intriguing Idea: read one page per day for one year and you will be up-to-date on a liftime of teachings from the man widely considered to be "the founder of modern management."

To condense 39 books into one book, and then to summarize that one book is a challenge beyond my capabilities. So, I'll summarize one day instead.

<b>November 12 | The Work of a Manager</b>

~ Managers set objectives
~ Managers organize
~ Managers motivate and communicate
~ Managers establish yardsticks
~ Managers develop people, including themselves

If your team does not grade you highly in each area, then you have some work to do the become a better manager.

This is a book of sound bites. Think of it as a movie trailer. It's designed to tease you and pique your curiosity to learn more.
