<blockquote>Success flows to organizations that inform, not organizations that promote.</blockquote>Today's customers are staring at an invitation avalanche, with every company asking for likes, follows, clicks and attention.  There are two ways for companies to break through this cacophony—be amazing or be useful.  It is difficult to be amazing, consistently.  This book is about being useful.

Youtility is marketing that is wanted by customers.  Youtility is massively useful information, provided for free, that creates long-term trust.  Youtility doesn't always require creating helpfulness from scratch.  Taking what already exists and putting it in an inherently more helpful format can be just as effective.

There are three ways to build Youtility:

~ provide self-service information
~ answer every question
~ be relevant in real time

Best concept explanation:

Zero Moment of Truth—that moment in which a customer decides to either take the next step in the purchase funnel, or to exit and seek other options.  Buy or bail.  It is at this moment when access to information reduces risk.  Customers want this information to be self-serve because we want to be left alone.  No phone calls.  No e-mails.

Best quote: "Content is fire and social media is gasoline."

The bottom line: We need to provide value to the customer other than simply giving them a product at a cheap price.  We need to differentiate ourselves to offer value that is beyond a product and a price.
