So, you want to run a high tech company? Start here.

Ben Horowitz worked for Silicon Graphics and Lotus Development before teaming up with Marc Andreessen at Netscape, Loudcloud and Opsware. Together, they now operate Andreessen Horowitz, a venture capital firm. This is the story about what Ben learned along the way.

Ten golden morsels:

~ My biggest single personal improvement as CEO occurred on the day when I stopped being too positive.

~ A company that discusses its problems freely and openly can quickly solve them.

~ "We take care of the people, the products, and the profits -- in that order." ~ Jim Barksdale

~ Startups should train their people. People at McDonald's get trained for their positions, but people with far more complicated jobs don't. It makes no sense.

~ Training is, quite simply, one of the highest-leverage activities a manager can perform.

~ The best companies invest time, money, and sweat equity into becoming world-class recruiting machines.

~ Directions with No Corrections: In a vacuum of feedback, there is almost no chance that your company will perform optimally.

~ The Law of Crappy People: For any title level in a large organization, the talent on that level will eventually converge to the crappiest person with the title.

~ Focus on the road, not the wall: Focus on where your are going rather than on what you hope to avoid.

~ By far the most difficult skill I learned as CEO was the ability to manage my own psychology.

The most interesting discussion centered around the description of managers as either Ones or Twos.

Ones like spending most of their time gathering information from a broad variety of sources. Ones love making decisions. Ones have great strategic minds. Most founding CEOs tend to be Ones.

Twos thoroughly enjoy the process of making the company run well. Twos insist on super clear goals. Twos get antsy wasting time thinking about strategy. Big decisions worry Twos much more than they worry Ones.

And there you have it. The world of starting and scaling a tech company according to Ben Horowitz. The Hard Thing About Hard Things: Building a Business When There Are No Easy Answers is one of the Best Business Books of 2014.
