How do you effectively lead a crew of more than 300 men and women?  The former commander of a U.S. guided missile destroyer offers an engaging and actionable battle plan.

When people leave companies, two out of three workers are actually leaving their managers.  At what cost?  The cost to the company.  The toll on the remaining workers.  Ineffective managers cost companies billions in lost revenues.  Yet, management training is virtually nonexistent in many companies, especially during the recent economic challenges.

One theme established early in the book is that leadership is earned, not designated.  Leaders must free their subordinates to fulfill their talents to the utmost.

Upon taking command of the USS Benfold, the author, Captain Abrashoff, reviewed exit surveys for reasons why people were leaving military service.  He assumed that low pay was the top reason.  It was actually #5.  Here were the top four reasons for leaving:

#1. Not being treated with respect or dignity
#2. Being prevented from making an impact on the organization
#3. Not being listened to
#4. Not being rewarded with more responsibility

The book details various steps Captain Abrashoff took to improve the Benfold's "readiness indicators" and earn the distinction as the most combat-ready ship in the Pacific Fleet.

He began by asking himself three questions:

~ Did I clearly articulate the goals?
~ Did I give people enough time and resources to accomplish the task?
~ Did I give them enough training?

The book then provides chapters of anecdotes about leadership issues including listening, communicating, trust, results, risks, procedures and more.

The most pleasant surprise about this book is the direct correlations Captain Abrashoff makes between leading a battleship and managing a business.  This book is a must-read for any business leader struggling with how to avoid mutiny while inspiring a team to become the best damn business in your industry!
