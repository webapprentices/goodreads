This book attempts to answer the following question:
Why do certain groups add up to be greater than the sum of their parts, while others add up to be less?
The short answer is that individual skills are not what matters. What matters is the interaction.

Build Safety is the first foundation on which a strong culture is constructed. Safety is a function of belonging and the cues that individuals receive in daily interactions should signal: You are safe here.

Share Vulnerability is the second cornerstone of high trusting work environments. A shared exchange of openness is the most basic building block of cooperation and trust. Spotlight your fallibility early on, especially if you are in a leadership role. The most important four words any leader can say is "I screwed that up."

Establish Purpose is the third leg of team-oriented workplaces. Envision a reachable goal and envision the obstacles. "This is why we work. Here is where you should put your energy." Create simple beacons that focus attention.

Numerous stories are told along the way to emphasize these three points.

In summary, the Culture Code can be summarized as follows:
We are close, we are safe, we share a future.
The Culture Code: The Secrets of Highly Successful Groups resides on The Must-Read Shelf of Best Business Books of 2018.
