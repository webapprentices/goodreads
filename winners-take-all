<blockquote>"This is a critique of a system of which I am absolutely, undeniably a part."</blockquote>

<p>Had this admission by the author been stated in the introduction, rather than in the acknowledgements at the end of the book, I might have been more open toward the author's seeming attack on anyone and everyone who achieved financial success and tried to do some good with their financial windfall.</p>

This critique is centered around the concept of MarketWorld — 

The author acknowledges that the U.S. Government is "arguably the most powerful institution in human history." Yet precious little effort is made to explain why the government has been ineffective in tilting the inequity imbalance in society. Nor does he attempt to reveal what he is doing to change the system that he admits to being a part of. My guess is that shining a light on the unfairness of MarketWorld is his contribution. I was hoping for more.
