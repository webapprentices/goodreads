<blockquote>"This is a critique of a system of which I am absolutely, undeniably a part."</blockquote>

<p>Had this admission by the author been stated in the introduction, rather than in the obscure acknowledgements section at the end of the book, I might have been more open toward the author's seeming attack on anyone and everyone who achieved financial success and tried to do some good with their financial windfall.</p>

<p>This critique is centered around the concept of MarketWorld — "an ascendant power elite that is defined by the concurrent drives to do well and do good, to change the word while also profiting from the status quo." The author states, "Many of them believe that they are changing the world when they may instead — or also — be protecting a system that is at the root of the problems they wish to solve."</p>

<p>Among the notables that the author sets his sights on are: Adam Grant, Brené Brown, Charles Duhigg, Malcolm Gladwell, Thomas Friedman, Simon Sinek and other "thought leaders." Confabs where MarketWorld club members gather, such as the Aspen Institute and the Clinton Global Initiative, are highlighted. Foundations and philanthropies funded by billionaires are also an easy target. The author's critique that "generosity is not a substitute for justice" when discussing the Sackler family is indeed notable.</p>

<p>The author acknowledges that the U.S. Government is "arguably the most powerful institution in human history." Yet precious little effort is made to explain why the government has been ineffective in adjusting the scale of inequity in society. Nor does he attempt to reveal what he personally is doing to change the system that he admits to being a part of. My guess is that shining a light on the unfairness of MarketWorld is his contribution. I was hoping for more.</p>
