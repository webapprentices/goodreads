This book is a worthy follow-up to Captain Abrashoff's management classic <strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/29068794">It's Your Ship: Management Techniques from the Best Damn Ship in the Navy</a>.</strong>  While the original focused on Captain Abrashoff's management experiences in the Navy, this book sails similar seas, but brings in real world examples from the business and sports arenas.

<strong>It's Our Ship</strong> is refreshing in the author's admittance of his shortcomings and lessons learned since writing [book:It's Your Ship|183392].  He quotes business and sports leaders in this follow-up and presents key leadership traits from a non-military perspective.

Companies featured include In-N-Out Burger, Able Distributors and Philadelphia Insurance.

Leaders discussed include Bill Walsh, former coach of the San Francisco 49ers, Ann Mulcahy, former CEO of Xerox and Donald Rumsfeld.

Still, the most compelling stories originate from Abrashoff's experiences in the Navy.  Two snippets that resonate include the following:

One negative: "My initiation to Albert David (a Navy frigate) was haphazard to say the least.  I had reported with high enthusiasm: now my concern became dread.  Here I was reporting aboard my frigate and no one seemed to know or care."

One positive: "I handed out 115 Navy Achievement Medals in my first year as commanding officer, instead of the fifteen authorized for my ship."

We can learn from good leadership examples, and take initiative on our own to lead regardless of our title, whether these examples originate in the business arena, on the gridiron or on the high seas.  Whether [book:It's Your Ship|183392] or [book:It's Our Ship|2869935], grab the wheel and take command!
