I almost didn't read this book. I use filters to identify books that are most likely to add value to my career. This book, on the surface, failed my two most useful filters. (More on this in a minute.) NOT reading this book would have been a mistake. Filters are NOT perfect.

Agile is the business philosophy that relies on fast-moving, self-managing teams for innovation. This book will not teach you the nuts and bolts of doing agile. It is designed to educate business leaders on the value of scaling agile effectively while maintaining a balance between innovation and bureaucracy.

Most people today work in bureaucracies, and most feel disengaged from their work. Every company needs bureaucratic structures and procedures to run their business. However, bureaucracies are terrible at innovating. Most large companies today have tilted too far toward bureaucracy, starving innovation. Enter agile.

Agile leaders spend less time reviewing the work of subordinates. They add value by spending time with customers, mentoring individuals, and coaching teams.

The authors proceed to cover such enterprise-level topics as the following:

~ How Agile Really Works
~ Scaling Agile
~ How Agile Do You Want to Be?
~ Agile Leadership

<strong>Doing Agile Right</strong> failed my first screen by only receiving one recommendation on my analysis of <strong><a href="https://beantownweb.blogspot.com/2021/08/best-business-books-2020.html" target="_blank">Best Business Books of 2020</a>.</strong> In addition, its Goodreads rating fell below my baseline threshold of 4.00. Nonetheless, this book is highly recommended for any leader tasked with improving the track record of innovation success within their organization.
