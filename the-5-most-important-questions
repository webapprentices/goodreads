<p>Simple. Brilliant. Simply brilliant.</p>

<p>Real world exercise:</p>

<p>In your next team meeting hand out a sheet of paper (yes, old school) and ask each person on the team to write down their answers to each of these five questions:</p>

1. What is our mission?
2. Who is our customer?
3. What does the customer value?
4. What are our results?
5. What is our plan?

<p>Then, compare answers.</p>

<p>If you and the members of your team disagree on the responses, then you as a team leader have work to do.</p>

<p>Get to work.</p>
