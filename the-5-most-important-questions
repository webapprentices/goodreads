Simple. Brilliant. Simply brilliant.

Five questions you need to ask about your organization.

Real world exercise:

In your next team meeting hand out a sheet of paper (yes, old school) and ask each person on the team to write down their answers to these five questions:

1. What is our mission?
2. Who is our customer?
3. What does the customer value?
4. What are our results?
5. What is our plan?

Then, compare answers.

If you and the members of your team are surprised at the responses, then you as a team leader have work to do.

Get to work.
