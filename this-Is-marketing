A Seth Godin book isn't necessarily a paint-by-numbers prescription for success. "Follow this plan and you too can become a marketer." Not so much. Serendipity and artistry are the order of the day. So, when reading a Seth Godin book you look for gemstones that shine in the stream of consciousness.

Gem #1: When in doubt, we selfishly shout.

~ If you find yourself selfishly shouting, then, perhaps you are offering something that isn't particularly helpful to your audience. The first step on the path to make things better is to make better things.

Gem #2: Marketing is the generous act of helping someone solve a problem. Their problem.

~ The answer to just about every question about work is really the question, "Who can you help?"

Gem #3: It doesn't make any sense to make a key and then run around looking for a lock to open.

~ The only productive solution is to find a lock and then fashion a key.

Gem #4: Your emergency is not a license to steal my attention.

~ Time to stop hustling and interrupting. Time to stop spamming and pretending you're welcome. Time to stop making average stuff for average people.

Gem #5: The shortcuts using money to buy attention to sell average stuff to average people are an artifact of another time.

~ Marketers don't use consumers to solve their company's problem; they use marketing to solve other people's problems.

Gem #6: Attention is a precious resource since our brains are cluttered with noise.

~ Persistent, consistent and frequent stories, delivered to an aligned audience, will earn attention, trust and action.

Gem #7: Find a position on the map where you, and you alone, are the perfect answer.

~ Walk away from the ocean and look for a large swimming pool. Begin there, with obsessive focus. Once it works, find another swimming pool.

These are just seven gemstones I gathered from this reading. Others are there, hiding in plain sight, ready for you to discover and put to productive use.
