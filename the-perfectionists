Precision is an essential component of the modern world, yet it is invisible, hidden in plain sight. <i><b>Precision</b></i> and <i><b>accuracy</b></i> are not exactly the same thing -- not precisely. <blockquote>If you describe something with great <i><b>accuracy</b></i>, you describe it as closely as you possibly can to what it is, to its true value. If you describe something with great <i><b>precision<b></i>, you  do so in the greatest possible detail.</blockquote>The story of precision begins in a timely manner in eighteenth-century England with the precise measurement of time using clocks. About the same time, the steam engine was invented and this machine required cylinders to be crafted with precision. The Industrial Revolution begins.

The "mother tool of the industrial age" was the lathe, a machine tool used to shape a piece of material, or workpiece, by rotating the workpiece against a cutting tool. With this level of precision came standardization and mass production. Precision brought social consequences. Skilled men were thrown out of work as machines were more precise and performed accurate work. Ned Ludd led a movement that become known as Luddism. The followers of this movement, Luddites, protested to protect their jobs. The year was 1811. Automation if society is not a new phenomenon.
