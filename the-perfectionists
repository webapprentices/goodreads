Precision is an essential component of the modern world, yet it is invisible, hidden in plain sight. <i><b>Precision</b></i> and <i><b>accuracy</b></i> are not exactly the same thing -- not precisely. <blockquote>If you describe something with great <i><b>accuracy</b></i>, you describe it as closely as you possibly can to what it is, to its true value. If you describe something with great <i><b>precision<b></i>, you  do so in the greatest possible detail.</blockquote>The story of precision begins in a timely manner in eighteenth-century England with the precise measurement of time using clocks. About the same time, the steam engine was invented and this machine required cylinders to be crafted with precision. The Industrial Revolution begins.

The "mother tool of the industrial age" was the lathe, a machine tool used to shape a piece of material, or workpiece, by rotating the workpiece against a cutting tool. With this level of precision came standardization and mass production.

Precision brought social consequences. Skilled men were thrown out of work as machines were more precise and performed accurate work. Ned Ludd started a movement. Followers of this movement, Luddites, protested to protect their jobs. The year was 1811. The fear of automation in society is not a new phenomenon.

The evolution of precision continues as the industrial Revolution crosses the Atlantic and takes hold in New England. Weapons were among the first machine-made objects to be created "lock, stock and barrel."

Horses still powered most machinery. With increased precision came iron versions of these horses -- first the locomotive, then the automobile -- with increasing "horsepower." Airplanes followed, then jet engines. Increased precision facilitated these advancements.

No aspect of modern life was left untouched by the precision movement. A few were explored in the remaining chapters:

~ photography, and other optical devices such as telescopes
~ Global Positioning System (GPS)
