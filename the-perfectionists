Precision is an essential component of the modern world, yet it is invisible, hidden in plain sight. <i><b>Precision</b></i> and <i><b>accuracy</b></i> are not exactly the same thing -- not precisely. <blockquote>If you describe something with great <i><b>accuracy</b></i>, you describe it as closely as you possibly can to what it is, to its true value. If you describe something with great <i><b>precision<b></i>, you  do so in the greatest possible detail.</blockquote>The story of precision begins in a timely manner in eighteenth-century England with the precise measurement of time using clocks. About the same time, the steam engine was invented and this machine required cylinders to be crafted with precision. The Industrial Revolution begins.
