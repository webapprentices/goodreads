Precision is an essential component of the modern world, yet it is invisible, hidden in plain sight. <i><b>Precision</b></i> and <i><b>accuracy</b></i> are not exactly the same thing -- not precisely. <blockquote>If you describe something with great <i><b>accuracy</b></i>, you describe it as closely as you possibly can to what it is, to it's true value. If you describe something with great <i><b>precision<b></i>, you  do so in the greatest possible detail.</blockquote>
