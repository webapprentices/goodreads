Management models based on planning and predicting instead of resilient adaptation to changing circumstances are no longer suited to today's challenges.  In this new model the role of the leader becomes creating the broader environment instead of command-and-control micromanaging.

General McChrystal (ret.) delivers a wealth of experience from his command of the Joint Special Operations Task Force doing battle against Al Qaeda in Iraq (AQI).  In order to effectively fight AQI the military has to quickly change competencies from efficiency (getting the most with the least investment of energy, time or money) to adaptability (learning how to reconfigure to confront the unknown in a complex environment).

McChrystal discusses business implications of his experience by looking back in history to Frederick Taylor and the movement to "make more, faster with less" that began in the early 20th century and came to pervade factory work, especially in the automotive industry.  One of his references is to <strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/340722501" target="_blank">American Icon: Alan Mulally and the Fight to Save Ford Motor Company.</a></strong>

While he brings in military history, as well as, business history, what I found most lacking was how his military experience of shifting competencies from efficiency to adaptability, using Teams of Teams, helps to transform a business.  A case study or two from his current role as cofounder of CrossLead, a leadership consulting firm, would have helped clarify his hypotheses for me.
