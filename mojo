<strong>Mojo</strong> . . . "You're moving forward, making progress, achieving goals, clearing hurdles, passing the competitionâ€”and doing so with increasing ease."

Mojo consists of four vital ingredients:

~ <strong>Identity:</strong> Who do you think you are?
~ <strong>Achievement:</strong> What have you done lately?
~ <strong>Reputation:</strong> Who do other people think you are?
~ <strong>Acceptance:</strong> What can you change, and what is beyond your control?

If you are not finding happiness and meaning in the present, then perhaps you lost some of your Mojo.  Marshall Goldsmith will help you get it back with the help of printed materials such as the <strong>Mojo Scorecard</strong> and guides including the <strong>Mojo Toolkit</strong>.

One measure I have for the effectiveness of a book occurs when the author hits a nerve.  Goldsmith has a way of facilitating an internal dialog that enables you to identify where you might be off track and how you can make a course correction.  His chapter on <strong>Mojo Killers</strong> is particularly enlightening.

Goldsmith has established a reputation as a premier executive coach. With <strong>Mojo</strong> he does not disappoint.  This book is a sold companion to his earlier work, <strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/29068716">What Got you Here Won't Get You There</a>.</strong>
