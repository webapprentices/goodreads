<strong>Change by Design</strong> is an insightful look at all sorts of organizations and how they solved challenges by working with IDEO, a global consultancy focused on helping companies innovate.

If you are new to design concepts, the following tools are discussed: brainstorming, scenarios, storyboards, story telling, mind mapping and prototyping.  Since these are right-brain tools and my brain seems to prefer functioning in left-brain mode, this book provided an adequate mind meld to get both sides to recognize each other.

I liked the author's definition of <strong>innovation: "a good idea executed well."</strong>  However, my right brain kept searching for a nice neat definition of design thinking, and alas, it become frustrated.  Upon review the best understanding I could come up with is that designers focus on a problem and design thinkers focus on a project.

The author also seems to prefer triplets when attempting to explain stuff.  Examples:

The three spaces of innovation:
inspiration | ideation | implementation

The three overlapping criteria for successful ideas:
feasibility | viability | desirability

The three elements of any successful design program:
insight | observation | empathy

An unexplained sine wave chart: 
hope | insight | confidence

<strong>Change by Design</strong> is more of a concept book that successfully makes the case that companies need to innovate to achieve success and remain competitive.  Design thinking is a vehicle that can help your organization accomplish that never-ending mission to innovate or perish.
