<blockquote>Without theory, we're at seas without a sextant.</blockquote>

Good theory helps people steer to good decisionsâ€”not just in business, but in life, too. However, the trap many people fall into is to allocate their time to whatever screams the loudest. That's a dangerous way to build a strategy.

Various theories are discussed here. One example is motivation theory. Two factors to consider within this theory are hygiene factors and motivation factors. Hygiene factors include things like status, compensation, job security and working conditions. Motivation factors include challenging work, recognition and personal growth. This second set of factors will motivate you and can make a difference between dreading or being excited to go to work every day. In order to find happiness you need to continue to look for opportunities to exploit these motivation factors. Careers that are often filled with motivators are often correlated with financial rewards.
