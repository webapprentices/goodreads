<strong>Thinking, Fast and Slow</strong> is a tour de force exploration of how the brain works on two dimensions (or systems).  The first dimension, System 1, is intuitive and fast thinking.  It operates automatically and quickly.  System 1 is impulsive.  The second dimension, System 2, is effortful and slower thinking.  It requires concentration and tires easily.  System 2 is capable of reasoning.

From this vantage point Nobel Prize-winning author, Daniel Kahneman, takes a deep dive into how humans thinkâ€”and don't.  Much empirical evidence is explored.  Along the way, constructs are presented including the following: executive control, flow, ego depletion, associative activation, priming effect, cognitive strain, confirmation bias, halo effect, judgement heuristic and mental shotgun; and that is just in the first 100 pages!

Therein, lies that challenge with this book; it is NOT a light read.  It requires System 2 concentration.  One of the beneficial features of this book is that every chapter ends with a "Speaking of ..." section that summarizes the key topics from that chapter in the form a sentence or two spoken by a human to explain a concept in a real world context.

Despite the wealth of information, I completed the book realizing that I had much evidence to work with, but precious few ideas on how to take advantage of using System 1 and System 2 to live a better life.  One statement did catch my attention, however.  <blockquote>"... one recipe for a dissatisfied adulthood is setting goals that are especially difficult to attain."</blockquote>If you are looking for a challenging academic read, <strong>Thinking, Fast and Slow</strong> should fit the bill.  If you are looking to operationalize these findings, you might want to turn to someone like Tony Robbins.
