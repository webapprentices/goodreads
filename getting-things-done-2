You can't be successful at getting things done if you don't know what all the things are that you want to get done. <strong>Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity</strong> provides an effective vaccination against day-to-day firefighting.

Stress typically occurs from inappropriately managed commitments you make or accept.  The Getting Things Done (GTD) methodology helps you clarify your commitments by getting them out of your head and specifying what "done" looks like.  The secret sauce is ... lists—lots of them!

It is a waste of time and energy to keep thinking about something that you make no progress on.  Instead, create a list, identifying the desired outcome and specifying the next action.  If the desired outcome requires multiple next actions then you have a project.  Most people have between 30 and 100 projects swimming around in their head, causing stress.  Get these projects out of your head!  Developing the habit of keeping nothing on your mind explains the Art of Stress-Free Productivity.

The behavior most critical for success is the Weekly Review.  Participating in this activity will likely prove frustrating if you haven't yet captured captured, clarified and organized all of your "stuff."  Then, and only then, can you make informed decisions about how best to productively focus your energies for the upcoming week.

GTD is a process.  It will take you two full uninterrupted DAYS just to get started on capturing, clarifying and organizing all of your "stuff."  It will take you two full YEARS to master this methodology.

Few books you read will have the potential to impact your personal productivity and clarify what is most meaningful in your life as <strong>Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity</strong>.

GTD—I'm a fan.  Give this methodology two full days and you might become one of the converted as well.
