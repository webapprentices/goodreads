When we buy a product, we essentially "hire" something to get a job done.  This book is about how to create products and services that you know, in advance, customers will not only be eager to buy, but willing to pay a premium price for.

If you build a foundation on the pursuit of understanding your customers' jobs, your business strategy  will no longer need to rely on luck.  The author, Clayton Christensen, calls this Jobs Theory (Jobs to Be Done) and it provides a powerful way of understanding the causal mechanism of customer behavior.  A well-defined "job" lies at the core of most innovation success stories.  Creating the right experiences and then integrating around them to solve a job, is critical for competitive advantage, which will be granted to whomever understands and best solves the job.

To elevate innovation from hit-or-miss to predictable, you have to understand the progress a consumer is trying to make in particular circumstances.  Customers don't buy products or services; they pull them into their lives to make progress.  A "job" is defined as the progress that a person is trying to make in a particular circumstance.  "Progress" is defined as movement toward a goal or aspiration.

Practical examples are discussed throughout the book and include initiatives undertaken by Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU), FranklinCovey, Intuit, ING Direct, Proctor & Gamble, Khan Academy, American Girl doll company, IKEA and OnStar.

When you're solving a customer's job, your products essentially become services.  Organizations that lack clarity on what the real jobs their customers hire them to do can fall into the trap of providing one-size-all solutions that ultimately satisfy no one.

If you can spot barriers to progress or frustrating experiences, you've found the first clues that an innovation opportunity is at hand.  The authors offer five ways to uncover Jobs to Be Done that might be right in front of you.

Remember, you're selling progress, not products.  Rarely is the product itself the source of long-term competitive advantage.  Customers won't resent the price; rather, they'll be grateful for the solution.
