The future is here and Elon Musk is delivering it.

Anyone interested in peaking behind the curtain to learn what it is like to start a company (or two or three) will likely enjoy this book. You may not like how the sausage is made, but startup endeavors are rarely pretty.

Elon Musk goes boldly where other entrepreneurs have gone and failed. SpaceX, Tesla and SolarCity are bold bets on the future, even bolder than Steve Jobs' vision for Apple and Pixar.

If you enjoyed Steve Jobs, then Elon Musk is cut from the same cloth, both in terms of readability and honesty. You may not want to emulate either entrepreneur's character traits, but there is no denying their uncompromising vision for inventing the future.

Elon Musk: Inventing the Future deserves its ranking as one of the Best Business Books of 2015.
