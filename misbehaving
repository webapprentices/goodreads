<strong>Misbehaving</strong> explores the world of consumer behavior, especially those behaviors that are inconsistent with the idealized model of behavior at the center of economic theory.  The core premise of economic theory is that people choose by optimizing.  Of all the goods and services a family could buy, the family chooses the best one that it can afford.  

The author refers to the fictional creatures that populate these economic models as Econs.  Econs misbehave—a lot!  These misbehaving Econs are referred to as Humans.  Understanding human behavior is every bit as important to running a successful business as is an understanding of financial statements and operations management.  To learn more about Humans, pay attention to Supposedly Irrelevant Factors (SIFs).

One SIF is referred to as the "endowment effect."  The stuff you own is part of your endowment.  People value things that are already part of their endowment more highly than things that are available, but not yet owned.  This effect helps to explain a predictable phenomena that Humans like gains, but they hate losses even more.  Humans typically hate losses twice as much as they like gains.  Loss aversion thus becomes a powerful tool in the behavioral economist's arsenal.

A few other interesting snippets:

~ When Humans do learn from experience (which doesn't happen as often as it should), two ingredients are necessary: frequent practice and immediate feedback.

~ Sellers have an incentive to manipulate the perceived reference price of a product or service and create the illusion of a "deal."

~ Retailers who attempt "everyday low pricing" (mimicking Walmart and Costco) generally fail unless they convince their customers that the entire shopping experience is an orgy of bargain hunting (Goodwill).

~ Ignoring "sunk costs" is generally a fallacy that Humans find  difficult to follow.  Business managers can be just as prone to this fallacy as consumers, and this can damage business operations.

~ Cash is easy to dispense with.  Money in an account labeled "checking" is slightly more difficult.  Labeling the same account as "savings" makes it harder for Humans to tap into.
