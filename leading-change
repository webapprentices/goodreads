<blockquote>"More organizations will be pushed to reduce costs, improve the quality of products and services, locate new opportunities for growth, and increase productivity."</blockquote>

<p>This statement is as true today (2022) as it was in 1996 when first written.</p>

<p><strong>[book:Leading Change|51370]</strong> is a blueprint for the cost/quality/growth/productivity challenge that virtually all organziations must confront. Start with the eight errors that most organizations face when wrestling with these issues. Then, outline an eight-stage change process to correct each of these errors. Simple and powerful, yet by no means easy.</p>

<p>One important understanding that must be established before, during and after the design and implementation of an organization change initiative is the distinction between management and leadership.</p>

<blockquote>Management is a set of processes that can keep a complicated system of people and technology running smoothly.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Leadership is a set of processes that creates organizations in the first place or adapts them to significantly changing circumstances.</blockquote>

<p>Successful transformation is 70 to 90 percent leadership and only 10 to 30 percent management. Most organizations are overmanaged and underled. Why? Most people are encouraged to learn management on the job and were taught very little about leadership.</p>

<p>In overmanaged organizations attempting to implement a change program, there is a lot more pushing than pulling, and ultimate success is much less likely. Transformation requires sacrifice, dedication and creativity, none of which usually comes with coercion.</p>

<p>Leadership goes hand-in-hand with lifelong learning, which helps to overcome the inertia of embracing the past and not the future. If you want to play a role in helping your organization reduce costs, improve the quality of products and services, locate new opportunities for growth, and increase productivity, then embrace <strong>[book:Leading Change|51370]</strong>.</p>
