The author uses corporate anthropology to work with owners of stalled businesses to jump start growth. Her anthropologist's tool kit includes the following:

~ Conduct observational research
~ Find customers' pain points
~ Use culture probes and storytelling

This book profiles the author's work with seven distinct mid-market companies and describes how corporate anthropology was used to move these companies in a profitable new direction. The case study I liked the most was Centenary College and their quest to move beyond being known as a two-year women's finishing school.

If you are a fan of Blue Ocean Strategy you will recognize the positioning concept of creating uncontested market space.

Among the tips I found useful:

~ Tell your story often; if you don't tell your story, people will make one up for you.
~ Want to change? Have a crisis or create one.
~ Business today is less about selling a product or a solution and far more about helping clients solve their problems collaboratively.
"We must know what the world needs first and then invest ourselves to supply that need, and success is almost certain." ~ Russell Conwell, Acres of Diamonds
Customers are trying to tell us something. It is time to hear them.
