The author uses corporate anthropology to work with owners of stalled businesses to jump start growth.  Her anthropologist's tool kit includes the following:

~ Conduct observational research
~ Find customers' pain points
~ Use culture probes and storytelling

<strong>On the Brink</strong> profiles the author's work with seven distinct mid-market companies and describes how corporate anthropology was used to move these companies in a profitable new direction.  The case study I liked the most was Centenary College and their quest to move beyond being known as a two-year women's finishing school.

If you are a fan of <strong><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/19663250">Blue Ocean Strategy</a></strong> you will recognize the positioning concept of creating uncontested market space.  

Among the tips I found useful:

~ Tell your story often; if you don't tell your story, people will make one up for you.
~ Want to change? Have a crisis or create one.
~ Business today is less about selling a product or a solution and far more about helping clients solve their problems collaboratively.
<blockquote>"We must know what the world needs first and then invest ourselves to supply that need, and success is almost certain." ~ Russell Conwell, Acres of Diamonds</blockquote>Customers are trying to tell us something.  It is time to hear them.
