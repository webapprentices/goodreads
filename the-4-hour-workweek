Blinded by the hype. More than a decade ago I established a system to help me identify which business books are most likely to add value to my career and to my life. This book did not rise to the top in my annual analysis of <b><a href="https://beantownweb.blogspot.com/search/label/books" target="_blank">Best Business Books</a>.</b> Nonetheless, I succumbed to the marketing hype and read it anyway. It did not disappoint. I wasn't expecting much and that's what I received, not much.

If you want to become a member of the New Rich (NR) you need to DEAL:

~ Definition
~ Elimination
~ Automation
~ Liberation

So far, so good. We should <b>Define</b> what we want, <b>Eliminate</b> activities that waste time, <b>Automate</b> activities that drain our energy, and <b>Liberate</b> our work by incorporating a mobile-friendly lifestyle.

It seems like, in order to attain <b>The 4-Hour Workweek</b>, one has to put forth an abundance of weekly effort far in excess of four hours. This approach makes me yearn for the days when work began and ended at a certain time in a known location, such as an office. We may never return to these days of future past. Nonetheless, I will continue in my quest for a more efficient lifestyle. I don't feel that <b>The 4-Hour Workweek</b> is the roadmap that will get me there.
