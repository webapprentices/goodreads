<p>Blinded by the hype. More than a decade ago I set up a system to help me identify which business books are most likely to add value. This book did not rise to the top in my annual evaluation of <b><a href="https://beantownweb.blogspot.com/search/label/books" target="_blank">Best Business Books</a></b>. Nonetheless, I succumbed to the marketing hype and read it anyway. It did not disappoint. I wasn't expecting much and that's what I received, not much.</p>

If you want to become a member of the New Rich (NR) you need to DEAL:

~ Definition
~ Elimination
~ Automation
~ Liberation

So far, so good. We should Define what we want, Eliminate activities that waste time, Automate activities that drain our energy, and Liberate our work life by incorporating a mobile-friendly lifestyle.
