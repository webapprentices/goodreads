<strong>Never Eat Alone</strong> is my second candidate for Best Business Book of 2008, even though it was published in 2005.  <strong><a href="Launching a Leadership Revolution">Launching a Leadership Revolution</a></strong> was my first selection.

The author had me hooked on page 1 (paraphrasing): "I was a country boy from Pennsylvania, raised in a small, hardworking coal town."  Since this passage succinctly described my background I was eager to learn more.

This is a book about developing relationships and succeeding in life.  Growing up in an era when lifetime employment was expected, the rules one generation later have tilted in the opposite direction.  This book shows you how to network effectively, continuously and relentlessly to help smooth the inevitable bumps in the road that will occur in our current "free-agent economy."  Continuous networking is the only viable option for advancement, and the currency of effective lifelong networking is generosity, not greed.

The author provides strategies for making contributions: "it's like Miracle-Gro for networks."  Strategies include establishing a mission and developing goals, but focus mostly on how to develop a team of like-minded friends and associates who can benefit from your knowledge and expertise.

Interspersed between the 31 strategy-packed chapters are eight "Connector's Hall of Fame Profiles" ranging from Benjamin Franklin to Bill Clinton.  All mastered the craft of networking and all made historic lifelong contributions to society.

The author summarizes his success strategies as follows: Being a leader in life takes practiceâ€”so practice!"
