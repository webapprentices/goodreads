You need to be good at something before you can expect a good job.  To land a great job you need to be "so good they can't ignore you."

This quote is attributed to Steve Martin.  

The core premise of the book is that pursuing a passion is filled with false promises.  A more effective strategy is to develop a craftsman mindset.  Getting good at something is a pursuit measured in years, not weeks.

In particular, the focus of your efforts should be to get good at something rare and valuable.  This strategy creates career capital.  Deliberate practice is the primary method you can use in your craftsman mindset approach.  

Best quote from the book:

"Wow, you got tenure early; what's your secret?"

"It's pretty simple, call me any Friday night in my office at ten o'clock and I'll tell you."

The take-home message: Don't obsess over your true calling.  Instead, master rare and valuable skills.
